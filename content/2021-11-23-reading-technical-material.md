In my day-to-day activities, I find myself consuming a lot of content;
more-so technical ones.  Here's a simple step-by-step process I
routinely, but not always, follow:

1.  Schedule reading and note-taking time.  Everyday, set aside a chunk
    of time that's only dedicated for reading.  While reading, try to
    take notes.  I try to use mind-maps where I can.  Also, for this
    you could try timed reading, whereby you set a timer and read
    within the limits of the timer.
2.  Prefer physical reading over reading on a laptop screen.  For this,
    I've gone to get physical copies of some books.  Also, it's worth
    mentioning that I prefer reading over on my Kobo than on my
    computer.
3.  Find a serene space to read.  If it doesn't exist, create one.
4.  Scan the text first.  Read the headings, sub-headings in addition to
    scanning key words highlighted sections.
5.  Read selectively if you have to.  Skip things you strongly feel you
    already know.
6.  Try not to sub-vocalise words.
7.  Write a summary, in your words when you've finished a reading
    session.  In cases where you were lost, go back to the text and
    correct yourself.
