## Free And Open Source(FOSS) Work {#free-and-open-source--foss--work}

-   I've started really taking a liking to [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.0.x/) over Python's in-built
    unittest because it's way less verbose(no classes[!]).
-   With [genenetwork](http://genenetwork.org/) work, I've got into the habit of: defining my
    problem (on paper in my Bullet Journal) before I mindlessly try to
    hack at a problem; iterate over my ideas ([again] on paper); and
    finally code a solution. One big problem I had to fix was: given 2
    uneven datasets(in the form of csv files), how would you normalise
    them so that you can run [csvdiff](https://github.com/aswinkarthik/csvdiff) on them?
-   Still working on these: [#77](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork3/pull/77) and [675](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/pull/675). These 2 need to be merged
    together. I aim to be done with them, tests and all, this week so
    that I move on to other more interesting things.


## Grad School {#grad-school}

-   Finished my group dissertation for some course unit.
-   I like my classes so far. The lecturers are non-judgemental. I've
    also been consistent with my note-taking (The Cornell Method)
    system, which has really helped me in being active in my classes.
-   Did some assignment(Linear Models) and submitted it in good time.


## Long Form Reading {#long-form-reading}

-   Some progress in: "Bad Science"

## Personal & Miscellaneous {#personal-and-miscellaneous}

-   Russia/ Ukraine conflict.
-   I seem to have broken my streak wrt waking up at 5:00 AM every
    morning. I'm back to the drawing board wrt this. To aid with my
    sleep, I placed an order for a new mattress. My old one was worn
    out; I could feel the wood structure under the mattress.
-   I passed on a recommendation to [gro-intelligence](https://gro-intelligence.com/). I'm happy working
    full-time in OSS in collaboration with my [colleagues](https://thebird.nl/blog/work/group.html). Also, I find
    the interviewing process very draining.
-   Practised my electric guitar once. I want to bump this up. I want to
    be good enough to be able to play in a band.
-   Got an hour glass!
-   Got an Eregatti hand-made notebook (woOt woOt o\_O o\_O)!
-   I want to learn about oppression and it's history.
-   A couple of power outages(worth mentioning because they lasted
    several hours each).
-   Something I realised on why some people don't like Science:
    "Historically, science has been used a tool of oppression by racists

​_[​sic]_​."

-   My eyelids got puffy, my eyes were red and aching.
-   Hanged out with some analyst and a dear one at Noir, Westlands.
