Today, I went to church at Woodley. Well, this is sort of a big deal for me. It was my first time to go to a church in a very long long time. Anyway, this [one]time, I went to a religious institution with an open mind- not asking questions. I wanted to see if I could learn something religious. I'm kinda [slowly] finding my way in religion, and what better way to do this than by going to a church? The rest of this post will discuss stuff I learnt from church. I really hoped I could get some of the slides that were used, but meh, church bureacracy's not my thing.

Today's sermon was on fasting. The types of fasting presented were:  
1. Normal fasting: No food, but you can drink water  
2. Dry fasting: No food, no water.

Another important thing covered was: _why fast?_ Several reasons were presented and examples cited from the bible. Among them was fasting during battles[Zahepheth or sth], fasting for reparation[Paul], etc. One thing that I felt was common in all these reasons presented was that there was some end goal in mind. From the sermon, fasting had to have a purpose.

After the main youth service, we went into subgroups and discussed fasting further. In my group, we got to talk about how to fast and how not to fast in addition to playing some weirdly fun game. When fasting, you need to be humble and generally a good person. You are not supposed to be hypocritical in your fasting. I kinda forgot the bible references here.

Well, all in all, my church experience was generally nice. I'll be going to church more often, out of choice. I'm also willing to accept that stuff I believe in is wrong. Technology has made me weirdly [abit]religious. I'll hold on to this and see where it goes.

Parting comments: Should you fast? Well, that's a personal choice. You make that choice.

Will I ever fast? I dunno. Time will tell?
