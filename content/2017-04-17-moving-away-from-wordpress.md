I've been using wordpress for 6 months now. Well, for my personal content, its about time I moved on to something I think is better. In my case, I've chosen Hugo, a static website generator that makes deployment of content quite easy.

I'm in the process of figuring how to automate the whole deployment of my articles to my server. Well, in the mean time, I'm enjoying working from my text-editor without the need of copying my content to some dashboard.
