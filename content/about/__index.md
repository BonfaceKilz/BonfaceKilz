___tl;dr:___ I love making cool stuff, reading books, competitive swimming, watching anime<strike>(The Sharingan is my favicon)</strike>, and playing the guitar. Oh, I love GNU/ Linux, GNU Emacs and free(as in GNU free) software. [Fully recovered] typography nerd. I'm also a wannabe Saitama Sensei[One Punch man!] in my spare time.

### About me
Well, I consider myself a master[Sensei] in the Art of Anything(Yes, I mastered AA). I do anything I find cool. Such things have included electronics, random coding stints, the guitar, books[Yes, books are cool] and swimming[nothing like a 50 fly]. I preach Emacs[I use it for everything] and I'm a Linux enthusiast.
