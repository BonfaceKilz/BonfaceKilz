## Free And Open Source(FOSS) Work {#free-and-open-source--foss--work}

-   Fixed _pylint_ errors in: [#88](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork3/pull/88).
-   I tried having _pytest_ run in [genenetwork2](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2). Unfortunately, at the
    moment, we'd have to re-write how flask is run in order to use it--
    a non-trivial task.
-   I created a [transient](https://issues.genenetwork.org/) UI for [tissue](https://tissue.systemreboot.net/), our [issues tracker](https://issues.genenetwork.org/). This needs
    more work. Track the progress [here](https://issues.genenetwork.org/issues/gnbug/add-transient.html).
-   I've made a commitment [​_to myself_​] to exclusively use [tissue](https://tissue.systemreboot.net/) and our
    [issues tracker](https://issues.genenetwork.org/) for all _genenetwork_-related work.


## Grad School {#grad-school}

-   Computed-- in R-- the MLE (Most Likely Estimator) of the Gamma
    distribution using the Newton-Raphson method.
-   I did a short presentation of my dissertation proposal. I will apply
    for a grant for this work.
-   After an upgrade of my system (both _GNU Guix_ and _Arch Linux_),
    R-Studio no longer worked. A fix was to run R-Studio with the
    `--no-sandbox` flag.
-   Hanged out with someone from my syndicate group. I taught him some
    _Functional Programming_ basics in a bid to clarify [​_to him_​] some
    assignment our group submitted that week.


## Books {#books}

-   Made some progress with: "The Sense of Style" by Steven Pinker.
-   Started: "Surrounded by psychopaths" by Thomas Erikson


## Personal & Miscellaneous {#personal-and-miscellaneous}

-   Important: I'm dropping my English name, _Bonface_. Please call me
    _Munyoki_.
-   Health-wise, I'm on my path to full recovery. Only concerning thing
    [​_to me_​] is that I've lost weight. I can attribute this to my poor
    eating habits.
-   I started planning my day in _chunks_. Every hour in my day has a slot
    allocated to something. This system is adaptive and every thing is
    neatly set up in my Bullet Journal. However, I haven't been
    consistent with this.
-   I aimed to start writing more articles in a week. To make this work
    in a consistent manner, I would have to create a system for this.
-   I [finally] got _flatpak_ working. I aim to eventually run every
    non-free binary inside _flatpak_. I want my system, with the exception
    of binary blobs in the GNU/Linux kernel, to be free from proprietary
    programs.
-   The [Nairobi Garage](https://nairobigarage.com/office-space-in-spring-valley/) has become noisy. I have to put on nature music
    on my head-set to work whenever I go to that space.
-   Here are some e-book readers you can write on with a stylus that my
    older sibling recommended: _Remarkable_ and _Super Note_.
-   Relationship problems; nothing much to say here other than: If we
    work through this, we will become a stronger couple; if we don't,
    we'll break up. This is personal territory I'm working on, and
    therefore I shall leave it at that.
-   My cursive has become snappier.
-   Random hang-out with the guys from the [NAILUG](http://nairobilug.or.ke/).
