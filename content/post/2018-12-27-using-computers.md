Computing has become an important driver in our daily lives. This is in the form
of our mobile devices (which power most of our daily interactions with other
people) and workstations(which is a big driving force in our work and private
lives). The internet has become more accessible and cheaper than ever before.
This has led to the rise of social media platforms(engineered to retain their
use) for different niches in our population.

Earlier today, I left my Android phone in an Uber. Initially, I panicked and
thought that I had permanently lost my phone. Later after calming down, I used
the Uber platform to report the missing phone. This did not work out well. I
dialled my line severally in the hopes that the Uber driver would pick it up.
Unfortunately, the phone was in silent-mode. Since the phone was ringing, I
figured that the phone was still on. I proceeded to use Google's [Android Device Manager](https://www.google.com/android/find?u=0)
to track my phone. I used this platform to remotely ring my device while
simultaneously placing a call. This finally caught the attention of the driver.
My phone was safely returned in a few hours.

In the period of time that I was phoneless, I felt "incomplete". All my instant
messaging platforms were moot, I couldn't read my mail, and the unnerving
paranoia of something fishy happening on my device hovered like some dark gloomy
cloud in my head. Needless to say, I was unproductive for a while. After getting
my phone back, it hit me hard just how dependent I had become on my devices.
This sparked some interesting conversation with the guys at the office.

I have become dependent on my computing devices. **Computing devices are meant to**
**be used, not the other way round**. However, it's becoming increasingly hard to
_"just use"_ your devices to get things done. I often find myself doing
time-wasting things on my devices to just pass time. I think that using
"closed-source" applications (which are sometimes marketed as "open source
applications") are partly to blame for this. These applications "just work" and
are convenient. They encourage consumerism, albeit in a techie landscape.
Companies and corporations that are behind these apps(and devices) collect your
data and do "things" with it, for their own benefit.

Some simple piece of advice from my boss may offer a simple solution to escaping
the computing dungeon a lot of us are in. It's simple: **use a computer to get**
**work done and have a life outside them**. Work in this context is used in a
loose manner to also encapsulate entertainment, exploratory stuff, and other
trivial things in addition to actual wqrk. The hugest take-away from this is to
be objective about what you want to do with the computer(or device). In my case,
I list down everything I want to do with my laptop before I open it. This
includes trivial things such as watching videos and browsing sub-reddits. The
next step I do is to put this list in some [org](https://orgmode.org/) file. I'll use this list to guide
me when doing things on my laptop. Once I'm done, I'll turn off my laptop and
do something else.

I don't know how extending the aforementioned ideas work out in a mobile device.
For starters, I want to install [Lineage OS](https://lineageos.org/) on my android device in a bid to
shake myself loose from Google(it's playstore and other default apps on
Android). From there, I will pick things up and continue my pursuit "freedom".
