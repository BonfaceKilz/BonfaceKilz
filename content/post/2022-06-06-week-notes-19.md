This is a new month! Albeit a very difficult one:
last year this month a high-school mate kicked the
bucket in a [tragic road crash](https://obituarykenya.co.ke/samuel-sasha-musungu/); and a dear one died
by [suicide](https://obituarykenya.co.ke/daniel-omondi-amenya/). I'm taking things one day at a
time. I'm sure I'll pull through :)

Also, this is the first time since I started
writing my weekly reviews where I skipped a
review. On that note, here's a lovely quote about
criticism that I stumbled upon:

> Psychologist and author Adam Grant on criticism:
>
> "Criticizing is easy and fast. Creating is
> difficult and slow.  The two hours you spent on a
> book or movie usually took two years to produce.
>
> Anyone can tear down someone elseâ€™s work. The true
> test of insight is whether you can help them
> improve it or build something of your own."


## Free And Open Source(FOSS) Work {#free-and-open-source--foss--work}

-   I haven't been able to do much coding wrt
    work. I took time off to study for my module
    finals. That said, I was able to squeeze in a
    wiki entry on how to use pdb [here](https://issues.genenetwork.org/topics/using-pdb-to-troubleshoot.html). Later this
    week I plan on having a session with one my
    team-mates to show-case how I use [pdb](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html) in the
    context of GN2.

-   I'll try prioritizing GN2 work related to RDF.

-   Catching up with mails/IM's.


## Grad School {#grad-school}

-   I had alot of anxiety/worry around doing
    exams. For one, I'm not allowed within [SU's](https://strathmore.edu/)
    campus grounds because I rock dreadlocks. This
    time, my usual invigilator wasn't around, so my
    course administrator had to look for someone
    else to do that work. Unfortunately, this turned
    out to be absurdly expensive: KES 1000 per hour!
    Each paper is 3 hours long, and I had 3 of
    them. Luckily for me, the course admin is a
    reasonable woman and we were able to reach a
    reasonable agreement; heck I was able to sit for
    my final paper within SU.

-   The exams went absurdly well for me. I thought I
    was under-prepared, but the "little" I [think I]
    did was good enough to ace those finals.

-   On the final day of my exams, we went out as a
    class---I left abit early though---to unwind at
    some joint. It was great to meet, in face, some
    of my classmates.

-   Each semester has been an improvement of the
    prior semester for me. Last semester, I stuck
    religously to taking great notes (first
    mentioned [here](https://www.bonfacemunyoki.com/post/2022-02-27-week-notes-6/)) and being really attentive in
    class. This coming semester, I want to stick to
    getting into the habit of scheduled revision,
    and somehow weave that into my routine in a
    sustainable way. Juggling school, work and
    family life can be a daunting endeavour.

-   I want to start work on my dissertation. I'll
    work on my "Literature Review" section. Part of
    that is already covered in my [grant proposal](https://github.com/BonfaceKilz/dissertation/blob/main/grant-proposal/grant-proposal.org).


## Long Form Reading {#long-form-reading}

-   I started reading:
    -   SICP
    -   The Book Of Why
    -   Before They Are Hanged
-   I finished reading: "The Blade Itself" (The
    First Law Trilogy: Book 1) by Joe Abercrombie.


## Personal &amp; Miscellaneous {#personal-and-miscellaneous}

-   I'm grateful that I have been meditating
    regularly.
-   Bought 2 extra [Erreggati](https://www.facebook.com/Erregatti/) notebooks to last me
    the rest of the year. I also bought one for my
    partner.
-   Binged: "The Office" (the Amarican version)
    over the weekend.
-   Eminem released an extended version of his
    iconic album: "The Eminem Show."
-   Very insightful conversation with friends and
    family around exams, anxiety and dealing with
    traumatic experiences.
-   Started a meal plan.
-   Finally got around to filing last year's taxes
    ahead of the on-coming June deadline.
