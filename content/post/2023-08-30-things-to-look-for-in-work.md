In the grand scheme of our limited days, a hefty portion is spent grinding.  Seems only right to find joy in it, ey?  So, what's the essence of work?  Allow me to unveil, drawing from [Yass'](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yassmuse/) wisdom:

First, work on things that will put food on your table.  The belly must be filled before you make your move.

Next, work on things that carry with it a promise of anticipation.  A work on things you can look forward to; a beacon on the horizon, a spark of yearning/longing.

Thirdly, seek work you can actively contribute to in an impactful way.

Finally, work that teaches you things; an opportunity to learn and grow, each sweat dropped shaping a chapter etched in experience.
