## Free And Open Source(FOSS) Work {#free-and-open-source--foss--work}

-   This week was focused on making all the [tests](https://ci.genenetwork.org/) in [GeneNetwork](https://github.com/genenetwork) green.
-   Merged: [#86](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork3/pull/86), [#85](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork3/pull/85), [#84](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork3/pull/84), [#83](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork3/pull/83), [#77](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork3/pull/77).
-   Finally merged some work related to case-attribute data. We tested
    that with [@zsloan](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/pulls/zsloan). Some issues cropped up. I'll outline that in our
    issue tracker and send out an e-mail to relevant stake holders to
    address that.
-   I missed out on some important meeting (about processors); and this
    was because I couldn't get Zoom working on my machine(my phone was
    out too!).
-   This week my focus will be on outlining the top 10 (with 2 tests
    each) most important things/ functionality to have tested in [gn2](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/pulls/zsloan).


## Grad School {#grad-school}

-   Computed-- in R-- the MLE (Most Likely Estimator) of the Exponential
    and Pareto distribution using the Newton-Raphson method. I'll try
    hacking one for the Gamma distribution before my next class.
-   Fooled around with smoothing functions in R.


## Books {#books}

-   Finished the book: "Just A Book" (this book chronicles
    the band: "Just A Band").
-   Started and finished: "Deep Work" by Cal Newport.
-   Started: "The Sense of Style" by Steven Pinker.


## Personal & Miscellaneous {#personal-and-miscellaneous}

-   I'm healing really well. No more puffy eye-lids and lips.
-   Installed (against my philosophy of free s/w) Mi Home on my
    phone. It's cool to remotely control my device. I'd ill-advise any
    one to do this.
-   My young sister (11 y/o) got 2 puppies.
-   My cursive is becoming more snappy. My cursive is sexy ;)
-   Went to a dear one's birthday over the weekend.
-   My older sibling shared his tips on interviewing in the
    aforementioned birthday event.
-   Personal realisation: I like my sense of individualism; and I like
    quiet spaces.
