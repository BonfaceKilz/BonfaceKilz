Three weeks ago, I decided to switch from the QWERTY keyboard layout to the
[Programmer Dvorak keyboard layout](https://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/index.html). This layout is a modification of the Dvorak
keyboard layout which moves the characters that programmers usually need to the
fingers[^fn:1]. My boss' insistence on this layout's efficiency inspired me to try
out the layout.

So far(this is my third week), I'm okay with the switch. I have had to practice
how to touch type using a typing tutor from some [online resource](http://programmer-dvorak.appspot.com/). At first, the
switch was frustrating and confusing, but after a while, my fingers got used to
the new layout. Another side effect of adapting this keyboard layout is that it
has made my machine really hard to use for people who use the QWERTY layout.
Anytime a random person tries to type something on my machine, they
inadvertently type gibberish.

For anyone interested in learning Dvorak's history, look at this [zine](http://www.dvzine.org/zine/index.html). This zine
does a great job in explaining the history of both QWERTY and the Dvorak
keyboard layout.
