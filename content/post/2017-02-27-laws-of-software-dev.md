I found this lying somewhere in my hard drive and I found it amusing. It's probably from some article I read along long time ago. 

These are some "laws" that apply during software/ hardware dev work and I find them truthfull(and funny)!

Here goes:  
1. _Postel's Principle_  
Be conservative in what you send, liberal in what you accept  
2. _Parkinson's Law_ 
   Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.  
3. _Haack's Law_  
Work expands so as to overflow the time available and spill on the floor leaving a very sticky mess.  
4._Pareto Principle_  
For many phenomena, 80% of consequences stem from 20% of the causes.  
5. _Sturgeon's Revelation_  
Ninety percent of everything is crud.  
6. _The Peter Principle_  
In a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence.  
7. _Hofstadter's Law_  
A task always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.  
8. _Murphy's Law_  
If anything can go wrong, it will.  
9. _Brook's Law_  
Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.
The bearing of a child takes 9 months, no matter how many women are assigned.  
10. _Conway's Law_  
Any piece of software reflects the organizational structure that produced it.  
11. _Kerchkhoff's Principe_  
In cryptography, a system should be secure even if everything about the system, except for a small piece of information.  
12. _Linus's Law_  
Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.  
13. _Reed's Law_  
The utility of large networks, particularly social networks, scales exponentially with the size of the network.  
14 _Metcalfe's Law_  
In network theory , the value of a system grows as approximately as the square of the number of users of the system.  
15. _Moore's Law_  
The power of computers per unit cost doubles every 24 months.  
16. _Rock's Law_  
The cost of a semiconductor chip fabrication plant doubles every four years.  
17. _Wirth's Law_  
Software gets slower faster than hardware gets faster.  
18. _Zawinski's Law_  
Software gets slower faster than hardware gets faster.
