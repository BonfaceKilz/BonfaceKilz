Here is Paul Graham's review of SICP which you can read from Amazon
[here](https://www.amazon.com/review/R3G05B1TQ5XGZP/?ref%5F=d6k%5Fapplink%5Fbb%5Fdls). What I like about it is that he has some useful and interesting
things to say about reading difficult content.

> This is one of the great classics of computer science. I bought my
> first copy 15 years ago, and I still don't feel I have learned
> everything the book has to teach.  I have learned enough to write a
> couple books on Lisp that (currently) have four to five stars. Yet
> SICP, which is pretty much the bible of our world, has only three? How
> can this be?  Reading the reviews made it clear what happened. An
> optimistic professor somewhere has been feeding SICP to undergrads who
> are not ready for it. But it is encouraging to see how many thoughtful
> people have come forward to defend the book.

> Let's see if we can put this in terms that the undergrads will

> 1.  Kenneth Clark said that if a lot of smart people have liked
>     something that you don't, you should try and figure out what they
>     saw in it. List 10 qualities that SICP's defenders have claimed for
>     it.
> 2.  How is the intention of SICP different from that of Knuth?
>     Kernighan & Ritchie? An algorithms textbook?
> 3.  Does any other book fulfill this purpose better?
> 4.  What other programming books first published in the mid 1980s are
>     still relevant today?
> 5.  Could the concepts in this book have been presented any better in a
>     language other than Scheme?
> 6.  Who is al? Why is his name in lowercase?
