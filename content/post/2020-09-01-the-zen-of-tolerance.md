_[First appeared [here](https://www.draketo.de/english/zen-of-tolerance)]_

-   You **are** entitled to **voice your opinion**.
-   You are **not** entitled to **force it upon everyone**.
-   You are **not** entitled to **hurl hate** towards participants, since that would
    **disrupt communication**.
-   If you **cannot stay** respectful and **friendly** after being asked to, **I will
    unsee you** and advice others to do the same with a clear and brief
    explanation, so they can take an informed decision.

I will use technical means to realize the zen of tolerance.

Tolerance for intolerance is self-defeating. **Continuous disruption of
communication is censorship**.

This could also be called the paradox of free speech: your freedom of speech is
worth as much as mine. It ends where it impedes on mine. And vice versa.
