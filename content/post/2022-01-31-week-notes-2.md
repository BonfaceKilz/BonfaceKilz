## Free And Open Source(FOSS) Work {#free-and-open-source--foss--work}

-   At Genenetwork, we switched to [invoking guix shell](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html%5Fnode/Invoking-guix-shell.html) for development
    purposes.  In [genenetwork2](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2), we experienced a bunch of build failures
    because of a failing `python-seaborn` build.  This is tracked in Guix
    upstream [here](https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=53519).  To work around this, we patched this in our channel [here](https://git.genenetwork.org/guix-bioinformatics/guix-bioinformatics/commit/94f6951f33dd801d30afcd9e547498345a7f1f1d).
-   Fixed a build error in python-twint [here](https://git.genenetwork.org/guix-bioinformatics/guix-bioinformatics/commit/7bde2a7d4e0779ae9f1d8eb9b2e06d595128ddd9).
-   A tip from work on using Guix channels:

    > Unless you are doing a lot of changes to a specific channel("guix-bioinformatics"), prefer to the use of the "module" as a guix channel rather than loading it manually with the "-L" flag.
-   Updated my channels file to:

    ```lisp
      (cons*
       (channel
        (name 'guix-past)
        (url "https://gitlab.inria.fr/guix-hpc/guix-past")
        ;; The following lines allow 'guix pull' to authenticate
        ;; this channel.  It requires a recent Guix (July 2020)
        ;; and can be omitted with older versions.

          "0c119db2ea86a389769f4d2b9c6f5c41c027e336"
          (openpgp-fingerprint
           "3CE4 6455 8A84 FDC6 9DB4  0CFB 090B 1199 3D9A EBB5"))))
       (channel
        (name 'gn-bioinformatics)
        (url "https://git.genenetwork.org/guix-bioinformatics/guix-bioinformatics.git")
        (branch "master"))
       %default-channels)
    ```
-   Something I learnt when trying to install [gn-proxy](https://github.com/chfi/gn-proxy) (in racket): You
    can't do a `yes | raco pkg install`; Instead, run: `raco pkg install
        --auto`.
-   Finally merged [this](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/pull/661).
-   Started insisting on "syncs" during stand-ups.  Should people(myself
    included) feel the need to extensively talk about something, just
    schedule a sync with the necessary party.  Sync is short for
    "synchronize".
-   Based off a long mail thread, I documented some task that needs
    doing this week [here](https://github.com/genenetwork/gn-gemtext-threads/blob/main/topics/data-uploads/inserting-data.gmi).

-   Scheduled a GN101 meet with [Rob](https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/163/publications).  Many contributors to our
    genenetwork eco-system have no background in Genetics or Biology.
    This meet will fill in those gaps to make things easier on the
    contributors; in addition to allow any of the GN2 stake-holders to
    voice any concerns around contributions they may have.  I'll be
    setting up a BigBlueButton instance for that this week.
-   If you have info manuals, in Emacs, do "C-h i m Guix RET i
    local-file RET" to get info on "local-file".  I want to get into the
    habit of using this interface more to look up documentation.
-   Paired with [Zach](https://github.com/zsloan/) on Saturday.  Made `guix shell` work for him.
    Figured out the scope of what I wanted to work on this work; and
    also sync'd up on overlapping work.


## Grad School {#grad-school}

-   Un-installed GRETL.  We used this in one of our classes(Time Series
    Analysis And Forecasting).  I hate this s/w because it's primarily a
    UI driven tool(though you can script with it).  UI driven tools with
    many pop-ups are annoying to use in [tiling window managers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling%5Fwindow%5Fmanager).
-   Made some progress in our group term paper.  Started doing daily
    stand-ups.


## Books {#books}

-   Skimmed "Semantic Web for the Working Ontologist" 2nd Ed by Dean
    Allemang and James Hendler.  I'll try reading this later during the
    year.
-   Started re-reading "The Art of Nonviolent Communication" and finished chapter 1 and 2.
-   Made some progress in: "How To Read A Book".
-   Started reading: "Bad Science".


## Personal & Miscellaneous {#personal-and-miscellaneous}

-   I started an early morning waking-up routine where I wake up at 5:30
    AM.  Only day I woke up late(11:00 AM) was Thursday since I slept
    late the previous night.
-   I was running out of space because of repeated `guix builds` ad `guix
        pulls`.  I deleted docker images and containers-- all of them!  This
    cleared up 34.97 GB of memory!
-   Got some insight from a friend on how he goes about designing
    programs and projects.
-   Created an office checklist in my Bullet Journal.  The idea is to
    use this checklist every time I leave the house in ordet to prevent
    myself from forgetting anything important.
-   Tough week with my partner.  I kept misgendering them and it hurt
    them alot.  Now I get it-- why misgendering is hurtful.
-   I listened to Kenyan Oldies albums:
    -   E-Sir's "Nimefika"
    -   Jua Cali's "Sekta"
    -   Kleptomaniax' "M4E(Maniax 4 Ever)"
-   Hanged out with dear ones at the office on Friday in the evening.
-   Checked up on another friend on Sunday and wound up playing
    "UnderCover" which was mad fun.
