## Grad School {#grad-school}

-   Finished some take-away Continuous Assessment
    Test (CAT). Type-setting this CAT in LaTeX took
    me some time.
-   Continued Advanced Bio-informatics. This was an
    enjoyable experience for me. I should be done
    with this course this week.


## Books {#books}

-   Finished "The Godfather".
-   Bio-informatics books I'm yet to choose [only
    one] to start reading:
    -   "Genetics: From Genes to Genomes"
    -   "Essential Bio-informatics"
-   Started: "The Algorithm Design Manual 3rd ed." by
    Skiena.
-   Made some little progress with Steve Pinker's:
    "The Sense of Style".
-   Started reading:
    -   A Team of Rivals
    -   Tiny Habits
    -   All the Love You Need

    Noam Chomsky and Edward Herman.

        Effective Modeling for Linked Data, RDFS, and
        OWL (ACM Books)


## Personal &amp; Miscellaneous {#personal-and-miscellaneous}

-   Easter holidays. I was indoors on my
    computer. That got interrupted by an afternoon
    with a doctor friend. She's such a lovely and
    decent human being.
-   Random hang-out with a friend who has a young
    family. We talked about careers. He is
    interested in transitioning in to research work
    [away from a well-paying corporate job].
-   Random thought: I work with some brilliant
    exceptional people.
-   Practised some cursive. I want to have a better
    mastery of all the letter forms in the Palmer
    style of business writing.
-   I'm growing into a person that prefers "slow"
    media (_read long-form content_) over "fast"
    media.
-   Got some new office seat with good back support.
