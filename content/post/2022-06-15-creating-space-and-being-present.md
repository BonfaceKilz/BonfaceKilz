Some time ago, I noticed that people close to me
primarily talked about their
challenges/problems. Consequently, to liven things
up, I began starting my conversations with the
question: "What is the highlight of your
week/day?" This however back-fired with one of my
dear ones whereby they never felt heard. They felt
ignored. The optimistic question: _What is the
highlight of your week/day?_ came off as
dismissive; and this particular event sparked an
entire conversation about what it means it be
_present_; and what it means creating space for
someone.

Being present and creating space go hand in
hand. Common in both of them, you have to put in
some work to be a good listener, as oppossed to
just "hearing" what the other interlocutor is
saying. Here are some rough pointers that
characterize good listening and being present:

-   When listening, try to repeat what the other
    person just said in your own words to
    demonstrate your understanding. Usually, when
    you are off, you will be corrected.
-   Conversely, if you don't feel heard, request the
    other person to repeat your ideas. That may go
    something like this: "What do you think I'm
    trying to say?"
-   Should there be a major event, first acknowledge
    it's significance. As an example, say the other
    person is having a difficult time at
    work. Instead of just bull-dozing through the
    conversation into some other topic, spare a few
    sentences to acknowledge what they are going
    through. That may resemble: "Wow! Work is tough
    huh? Sorry you are going through this."
-   People don't want solutions. Should you feel the
    itch to give one, ask you interlocutor if they
    want/need it. Here's one of my favourite
    phrases: "Do you want to hear my opinions on the
    matter?"
-   Conversations are not debates/arguments; and if
    they are, acknowledge them as such pretty early
    on. That said, be careful with how you give
    criticism. People tend to put up walls when they
    feel attacked, and as such, when having a
    conversation, you should be wary of this.
-   Should a conversation be offensive, you can
    politely leave, instead of spending more mental
    energy on a draining activity.
-   In some situations, it's fine to ask the other
    person what being present looks like; and what
    being heard feels like. Let them help you out in
    figuring this out.

To close this post, I want to highlight the fact
that you may not always have the mental energy to
be a good listener or be present in a
conversation. That's ok. You can let the other
person know, and should they want your full
presence, you can post-pone your conversation to a
later time.
