Here's a quote---front page of SICP---by Alan
J. Perlis that captures the "joy of computing"
that I sometimes feel/get:

> "I think that it's extraordinarily important
> that we in computer science keep fun in
> computing.  When it started out, it was an
> awful lot of fun.  Of course, the paying
> customers got shafted every now and then, and
> after a while we began to take their
> complaints seriously.  We began to feel as if
> we really were responsible for the
> successful, error-free perfect use of these
> machines.  I don't think we are.  I think
> we're responsible for stretching them,
> setting them off in new directions, and
> keeping fun in the house.  I hope the field
> of computer science never loses its sense of
> fun.  Above all, I hope we don't become
> missionaries.  Don't feel as if you're Bible
> salesmen.  The world has too many of those
> already.  What you know about computing other
> people will learn.  Don't feel as if the key
> to successful computing is only in your
> hands.  What's in your hands, I think and
> hope, is intelligence: the ability to see the
> machine as more than when you were first led
> up to it, that you can make it more."
