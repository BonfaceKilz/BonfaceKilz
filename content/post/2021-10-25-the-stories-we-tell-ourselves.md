Here's another one from one of James Clear's newsletter:

> A parable from priest and therapist Anthony de
> Mello on the stories we tell ourselves:
>
> “A man found an eagle's egg and put it in a nest
> of a barnyard hen. The eaglet hatched with the
> brood of chickens and grew up with them.
>
> All his life the eagle did what the barnyard
> chicks did, thinking he was a barnyard chicken.
> He scratched the earth for worms and insects. He
> clucked and cackled. And he would thrash his
> wings and fly a few feet into the air.
>
> Years passed and the eagle grew very old. One day
> he saw a magnificent bird above him in the
> cloudless sky. It glided in graceful majesty
> among the powerful wind currents, with scarcely a
> beat of its strong golden wings.
>
> The old eagle looked up in awe. “Who's that?” he
> asked.
>
> “That's the eagle, the king of the birds,” said
> his neighbor. “He belongs to the sky. We belong
> to the earth—we're chickens.”
>
> So the eagle lived and died a chicken, for that's
> what he thought he was.”
