On exactly the same day(today), last year, a close
[friend](https://obituarykenya.co.ke/daniel-omondi-amenya/) passed away. Indeed, a sad day for me. But
nevertheless, you have to keep moving. _[And I
quote Logen---First Law Trilogy]_ "You have to be
realistic about these things."


## Free And Open Source(FOSS) Work {#free-and-open-source--foss--work}

-   I gave a presentation based on [this](https://issues.genenetwork.org/topics/using-pdb-to-troubleshoot.html) about [python pdb](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html) in
    last week's stand-up. This presentation went
    well.
-   I got stuck trying to learn how to generate an
    ontology for some tables that contain
    "case-attributes" for experimental data. Winded
    up _[in a rabbit hole]_ reading [this](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/ontologies-in-detail-2916f9226133) and
    [this](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/prot%C3%A9g%C3%A9-d533f024087b). Also, I got a bit hung up trying to build
    an ontology "the right way" first using a tool
    called Protege. Heck, I even fixed some weird
    display bug in Protege and briefly mentioned it
    [here](https://www.bonfacemunyoki.com/post/2022-06-07-fixing-display-bug-in-protege/). I quickly abandoned this strategy: having
    a working ontology; and adapted a more flexible
    mind-set of generating RDF ttls first, and
    finding ways to relate them.
-   At one point, I almost wrote my own code
    snippets to convert sql data into RDF---was
    really stumped about how to go about that
    despite having some interesting ideas. Luckily
    for me, [AI](https://www.systemreboot.net/) wrote an impressive [macro](http://git.genenetwork.org/arunisaac/dump-genenetwork-database/src/commit/de3ad2c960a36d671c23602f03d60f4422881d6a/dump.scm#L257-L357) that
    already does most of the heavy-lifting for me. I
    spent quite some time understanding how this
    snip works. This was a time sink, but most
    definitely worth it!
-   I was able to generate RDF files in turtle format
    for a particular subset of the data
    (case-attributes). I noticed that the generated
    RDF is not valid. I'll work out "why" later
    during the week.
-   I have _editor_ access to GN1. Later this week (or
    the weekend), I'm going to try and fix up some
    parities between GN1 and GN2.
-   Today, I hacked setting up virtuoso within a
    GUIX Container; and also successfully ran SPARQL
    queries using both the web UI and isql. I wasn't
    able to upload the aforementioned generated data
    into Virtuoso. I'll work on that tomorrow after
    fixing up the generated turtle files.
-   I noticed some new _[minor but welcome]_
    contributions on GN2. Some of them have not been
    merged. I'll allocate some time this week to
    have those merged.
-   This coming month, I'll be in charge of our
    [issues list](https://issues.genenetwork.org/).
-   Failing [GN2 tests](https://ci.genenetwork.org/jobs/genenetwork2), [GN3 mypy](https://ci.genenetwork.org/jobs/genenetwork3-mypy) and [GN3 pylint](https://ci.genenetwork.org/jobs/genenetwork3-pylint)
    checkers. I'm thinking of delegating this work
    to someone. If that's not feasible, I'll hack on
    them myself and track it in our issue tracker.
-   Not sure if I can squeeze this in, but I want to
    review [this](https://github.com/Alexanderlacuna/correlation_rust/tree/main/src) and give useful feedback for some
    on-going project that a team-mate has been
    working on for some time now.


## Grad School {#grad-school}

-   We haven't had any classes this past 1
    week. That's out of the normal. I suspect
    there's something outside the purview of us
    students that's going down.
-   Rumour's going around that there may be physical
    classes---we've been having online classes so
    far.
-   Last module's results should be out this week,
    on next week. I'm sure I did well, so I'm not
    anxious about them.


## Long Form Reading {#long-form-reading}

-   Finished reading "Before They Are Hanged" (Book
    II of the First Law Trilogy) by Joe Abercrombie.
-   Made some progress in: "Getting The Love You
    Want" by Harville Hendrix


## Personal &amp; Miscellaneous {#personal-and-miscellaneous}

-   I have a bad cold, but I'm fine.
-   I got some old printer. [Here](https://www.bonfacemunyoki.com/post/2022-06-13-setting-up-a-hp-printer-in-linux/) is how I configured
    it. Ink cartridges are pricey woOt!
-   Started a meal plan with a dear one helping me
    out. I have to work out how to store food in the
    fridge/freezer in ways that doesn't
    inconvenience my house mates.
-   Got around to watching the documentary "[Jagged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagged_(film))".
-   Lots of love and support from family and
    friends. This week is a [dark](https://obituarykenya.co.ke/daniel-omondi-amenya/) one; and it so
    happens to be my birthday week. Not in a
    celebratory mood at all.
-   Fixed some long-running terminal [issue](https://www.bonfacemunyoki.com/post/2022-06-08-generating-per-user-locales/).
-   Switched to using modus-vivendi (an in-built GNU
    Emacs theme). My configs are converging towards
    a minimal system.
-   I hosted a book club meetup over the
    weekend. [Here](https://upbookclub.com/t/recommended-books-media-from-last-weeks-hangout/115) were some recommended books/media.
