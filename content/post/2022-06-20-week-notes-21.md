## Free And Open Source(FOSS) Work {#free-and-open-source--foss--work}

-   We had a round table with [William E. Byrd](http://webyrd.net/).
    He showed us some of the cool things he has been working on, in particular [mediKanren](https://github.com/webyrd/mediKanren)---a system for bio-medical reasioning---and some of its cool use-cases.
    It's written in a lisp!
    This [article](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/264042/20210811/ai-known-medikanren-helps-find-treatment-rare-neuro-condition-other-illness.htm) shows some of the interesting ways it has been used.
-   Gave a presentation---during my weekly stand-ups---on the _case-attributes_ ontology I generated. This was well-received.
    For this week, I'll submit a patch to the relevant repository and see if I can replace some SQL queries with RDF ones in GN3.
-   For this week, I'll see if I can fetch [this](https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/resources/mouse-phenome-database) and [this](https://phenome.jax.org/search/details/archives?searchterm=diabetes+) datasets, upload them somewhere in the GN infrastructure, match it with a genotype file, run pre-computed mapping (correlations), update metadata and link out to RDF.
    I may have to break this task further into more manageable do-able sub-tasks.
-   I successfully set-up an NNTP server to fetch mail from popular mailing lists from [gmane](https://gmane.io).
    I've also been able to configure my GNUs newsreader client to read and send mail, specifically for mailing lists.
    However, I haven't had success with making notmuch search through the fetched news items.
    Regardless, this is a big first step for me on my path to being a more active contributor to some of these bigger FOSS projects.
    I intend to set aside some time every day to skim these lists.
    I reckon I have a lot to learn.
-   I'm trying to get into the regular grove of triaging GN's [issue tracker](https://issues.genenetwork.org/) on a daily basis.
    I'll try to improve on this in the coming few day.
    That would mean defining _[at least to myself]_ how that looks like.


## Grad School {#grad-school}

-   Classes officially began on Monday.
    The time-table was shared some time on Sunday.
    Classes will be hybrid in nature; lecturers who are based abroad will have their classes in zoom.
    Otherwise, there will be physical classes with the allowance of a virtual class for students based outside Nairobi.
    Unfortunately, we have classes every other week-day.
    In previous semesters, we had at least one day off.
    I guess this is because of the coming elections which will eat into our time.
-   For this semester, I'm going to be more pro-active.
    In addition to taking more meaningful easier-to-digest notes, I want to get into the grove of regular revision.
    Before every class, I'll take a break so that I'm fresh---classes are 3 hours long and I need all the energy I can muster.
    Later this week, I'll meet up with some class-mate to have some form of group discussion, and if feasible, hack on free software ;)
    The goal of all the _pro-activity_ is to make things easier on myself and to have a more balanced life/work/school balance.
-   Results aren't out yet.
    I expect that they'll be released some time this week.


## Long Form Reading {#long-form-reading}

-   Made little progress in: "Getting All The Love You Want" by Harville Hendrix.
-   Tried to read SICP.
    I'll put a more concerted effort this week ;)


## Personal &amp; Miscellaneous {#personal-and-miscellaneous}

-   I've been regularly practising my typing.
    My goal is to hit a speed of over 100 WPM.
-   _[The Kenyan]_ Parliament had passed a [controversial ICT Practitioners Bill](https://techweez.com/2022/06/09/parliament-has-passed-the-controversial-ict-practitioners-bill/) with the aim of "regulating" the industry.
    Also, some "coding curruculum" was shared in some mailing list.
    You can view it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DLJ2Ss6ZFWaQDQuV5TYbM4wgm7CFx5gj/view?usp=drive_web).
-   Went to the hospital. The "bad cold" I though I had turned out to be atypical pneumonia.
    Was given some strong medication, and now I'm feeling much better.
-   A former university class-mate's company made it to the Ycombinator. Read more [here](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/patika).
-   At one point last week, as part of my work-break here at the Nairobi Garage---a co-working space---I attended some event themed "web3.0".
    As usual with events surrounding crypto, buzz-words were thrown around, and that made some people _[not me]_ smile.
-   I admire and look up to: [anthonywritescode](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC46xhU1EH7aywEgvA9syS3w).
-   It was my birthday last Saturday.
    I _never_ celebrate it.
    This being the first time in my adult-hood to do so willingfully, we went out bike-riding at Karura forest, and thereafter went for dinner at a Chinese restaurant.
    I wrapped up the night by going to a game-night hosted by a dear friend.
    This was mad fun!
-   This little [hack](https://github.com/BonfaceKilz/emacs.d/commit/f6b3421f7820f6f8774e90100216bf15f5030c95) sped up my GNU Emacs signifantly.
    No more calling home (elpa/melpa) on start-up.
    Such a subtle bug!
-   I'm getting into the habit of having a clear and "START/STOP" routine for most of my routines.
    This prevents "tunnel-vision" [at least for me] when working on things.
