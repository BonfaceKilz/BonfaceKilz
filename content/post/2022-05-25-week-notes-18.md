## Free And Open Source(FOSS) Work {#free-and-open-source--foss--work}

-   Triaged my issue list and I closed some stale issues:
    -   <https://issues.genenetwork.org/issues/fetch-sample-data.html>
    -   <https://issues.genenetwork.org/issues/zero-repr-in-data-upload.html>
    -   <https://issues.genenetwork.org/issues/gn3-technical-debt.html>
-   I'm mostly done with this [issue](https://issues.genenetwork.org/issues/case-attr-edit-error.html). I should be
    closing it some time this week.
-   Switched to using [pdb](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html) from [pudb](https://pypi.org/project/pudb/) for
    troubleshooting GN2/GN3 python code.


## Grad School {#grad-school}

-   This week is study week in preparation for next
    week's exams.
-   I'm abit concerned about taking exams next
    week. I'm physically banned from SU because of
    my [dreadlocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination_based_on_hair_texture). I'll reach out to SU admin and
    see if we can get an examiner that'd be willing
    to come and invigilate my exams outside SU---the
    struggle! I wonder: _Why do I put up about this?_
-   I haven't been studying this week. I've been
    reacting to some _grave_ personal emergencies in
    my life that I'm not willing to disclose. I'm
    fine though.
-   No feedback on some grant proposal---first
    mention of it is [here](https://www.bonfacemunyoki.com/post/2022-05-04-week-notes-15/).


## Long Form Reading {#long-form-reading}

-   Made some progress in:
    -   "The Blade Itself"
    -   "Tiny Habits"


## Personal &amp; Miscellaneous {#personal-and-miscellaneous}

-   Started using [qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org/) for my day-to-day
    browsing.
-   Stressful problems about transferring money
    using [wise](https://wise.com). This is a blocker for many things in
    my life ðŸ˜¢.
-   Someone dear to me is dealing with a sexual
    predator. We've taken necessary precautions
    against him. Dude is creepy!
-   Last week I was invited to a birthday event for
    a dear one at [Hero](https://www.hero-kenya.com/)---a comic themed
    eatery/hotel. The experience was nice, a nice
    intersection of good food and a comic/hero
    themed space.
-   Sorted out my payment issues about Scaleway
    (mentioned [here](https://www.bonfacemunyoki.com/post/2022-05-18-week-notes-17/)).
