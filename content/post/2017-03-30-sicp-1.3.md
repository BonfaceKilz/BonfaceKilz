Any powerful powerful programming language should have the ability to form abstractions using procedures by assigning names to common patterns. _Higher order procedures_ are procedures that manipulate other procedures.

Forming higher order procedures makes code more readable and easier to manage. In the book, a higher order procedure that behaves in a similar fashion to &Sigma; was constructed. The concept of a procedure that takes both procedures and variables as arguments is amazing(the first I saw this I thought it was wizardry).

Also, the use of the lambda function to define functions was explored. The difference between the `lambda` function and the `define` function is that in the `lambda` function, no name is specified for the procedure. `Let` is syntactic sugar which makes making internal definitions easier to do.

How is lambda and let used? Read more about them [here](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ssch9/lambda.html )
