## Free And Open Source(FOSS) Work {#free-and-open-source--foss--work}

-   I successfully dumped the Genenetwork relational
    database to a plain text and RDF database by
    following [this](https://git.genenetwork.org/arunisaac/dump-genenetwork-database/src/branch/master/README.org).
-   I created a shepherd user in my system, similar
    to something genenetwork does. This allows me to
    run services in a foreign distro(Arch Linux).
-   Most of my time was spent work on my
    [grant-proposal](https://github.com/BonfaceKilz/dissertation/blob/main/grant-proposal/grant-proposal.org) which aligns to GN.


## Grad School {#grad-school}

-   Met up with my supervisor [Shelby](http://www.shelbydarnell.com/) to discuss my
    grant proposal. He had some [useful feedback](https://github.com/BonfaceKilz/dissertation/issues/1) and
    I incorporated those during my re-iterative
    edits.
-   I finished a course in Advanced
    Bio-informatics. I'm expecting to sit for an
    exam this week on Friday.


## Books {#books}

-   I made some progress in:
    -   "Team of Rivals."
    -   BJ Fogg's "Tiny Habits."
    -   Harville Hendrix' "Getting The Love You Want."


## Personal &amp; Miscellaneous {#personal-and-miscellaneous}

-   Google are [hiring](https://africa.googleblog.com/2022/04/were-hiring-for-our-first-product.html?m=1) here in Nairobi.
-   In my org workflow, I've been trying to make my
    tasks as atomic as possible.
-   [Mwai Kibaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mwai_Kibaki), Kenya's third president, passed
    away.
-   I had a conversation with a dear one about
    mental health, and how it's important to always
    take care of yourself. Importantly, you should
    do this from a place of self-love, not because
    you are "damaged" and need to be "fixed."
-   A dear one and her partner had travelled from
    Rwanda, and they came to visit us. I got some
    really good Rwandan t-shirt!
-   A very brutal murder of [Sheila Adhiambo Lumumba](https://queerethiopia.com/2022/04/23/we-are-all-sheila-adhiambo-lumumba/).
    This got to me and is painful to read :'(
-   I'm getting into the habit of meditating. I use
    the "Waking Up" app as a guide.
-   A work-ation has been organised by dear
    ones. The idea: get away from the city, and find
    a quiet place to work and get some good reading
    done.
