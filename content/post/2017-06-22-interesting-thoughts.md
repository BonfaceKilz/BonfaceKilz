I've been reading the book: **True Believer** and I've found some things quite interesting. In this article, I will discuss couple of the things that I found interesting.

> The despair brought by unemployment comes not only from the threat
> of destitution, but from the suddent view of a vast nothingness
> ahead. The unemloyed are more likely to follow the peddlers of hope
> than the handers out of relief.

> A man is likely to mind his own business when it is worth minding.
> When it is not, he takes his mind off his own meaningless affairs
> by minding other people's business.
> This minding of other people's business expresses itself in gossip,
> snooping and meddling. and also feverish interest in communal,
> national and racial affairs. In running away from ourselves we either
> fall on our neighbour's shoulder or fly at his thought.

> The burning conviction that we have a holy duty toward others is
> often a way of attaching our drowning selves to a passing raft. What
> looks like giving a hand is often a holding on for dear life. Take
> away our holy duties and you leave our lives puny and meaningless.
> There is no doubt that in exchanging a self-centered for a selfless
> life we gain enormously in self-esteem. The vanity of the selfless,
> even those who practise utmost humility, is boundless.

> The inert mass of a nation is in its middle section. The decent,
> average people who do the nation's work in cities and on the land
> are worked upon and shaped by minorities at both ends- the best
> andthe worst.

> The game of history is usually played by the best and the worst
> over the heads of the majority in the middle.

> The reason that the inferior elements of a nation can exert a marked
> influence on its course is that they are wholly without reverence
> toward the present. They see their lives and the present as spoiled
> beyond remedy and they are ready to waste and wreck both: hence their
> recklessness and their will to chaos and anarchy. They also crave to
> dissolve their spoiled, meaningless selves in some soul-stirring
> spectacular communal undertaking- hence their proclivity for united
> action. Thus they are among the early recruits of revolutions, mass
> migrations and of religious, racial and chauvinist movements which
> shape a nation's character and history. The discarded and rejected
> are often the raw material of nation's future. The stone the builders
> reject becomes the cornerstone of a new world. A nation without dregs
> and malcontents is orderly, decent, peaceful and pleasant, but
> perhaps without the seed of things to come.

> Our frustrations is greater when we have much and want more than
> when we have nothing and want some. We are less dissatisfied when
> we lack many things than when we seem to lack but one thing.

> Freedom aggravates at least as much as it alleviates frustration.
> Freedom of choice places the whole blame of failure on the shoulders
> of the individual. And as freedom encourages a multiciplity of
> attempts, it unavoidably multiplies failure and frustration. Freedom
> alleviates frustration by making available the palliatives of action,
> movement, change and protest.

> Unless a man has the talents to make something of himself, freedom is
> an irksome burden. Of what avail is freedom to choose if the self be
> ineffectual?

> Those who see their lives as spoiled and wasted crave equality and
> fraternity more than they do freedom. If they clamor for freedom, it
> is but freedom to establish equality and uniformity. The passion for
> equality is partly a passion for anonymity: to be one thread of the
> many which make up a tunic; one thread not distinguishable from the
> others. No one can then point us out, measure us against others and
> expose our inferiority.

> They who clamor loudest for freedom pare often the ones least likely
> to be happy in a free society. The frustrated, oppressed by their
> shortcomings, blame their failure on existing restraints.

> The inordinately selfish are particularly susceptible to frustration.
> The more selfish a person, the more poignant his disappointments. It
> is the inordinately selfish, therefore, who are likely to be the most
> persuasive champions of selflessness.

> A minority is in a precarious position, however protected it be by law
> or force. The frustration engendered by the unavoidable sense of security
> is less intense in a minority intent on preserving its identity than in
> one bent upon dissolving in and blending with the majority. A minority
> which preserves its identity is inevitably a compact whole which shelters
> the individual, gives him a sense of belonging and immunizes him against
> frustration. On the other hand, in a minority bent on assimilation, the
> individual stands alone, pitted against prejudice and discrimination. He
> is also burdened with the sense of guilt, however vague, of a renegade.

> When the individual faces torture or annihilation, he cannot rely on the
> resources of his own individuality. His only source of strength is not being
> himself but part of something mighty, glorious and indestructible. Faith here
> primarily a process of identification.p

> Those without hope are divided and driven to desperate self-seeking.

> Failure in the management of public management of practical affairs seems to
> be a qualification for success in the management of public affairs. And it is
> perhaps fortunate that some proud natures when sufferign defeat in the
> practical world do not feel crushed but are suddenly fired with the
> apparently absurd conviction that they are eminently competent to direct the
> fortunes of the community and the nation.

> The effectiveness of a doctrine does not come from its meaning but from its
> certitude. No doctrine however profound and sublime will be effective unless
> it is presented as the embodiment of the one and only truth. It must be the
> one word from which all things are and all things speak. Therefore, for a
> doctrine to be effective , it must not be understood, but has rather to be
> believed in. We can only be absolutely certain only about things we do not
> understand. Hence the devout are always urged to seek the absolute truth with
> their hearts and not their minds. "It is the heart which is conscious of God,
> not the reason; God is beyond our human understanding."
