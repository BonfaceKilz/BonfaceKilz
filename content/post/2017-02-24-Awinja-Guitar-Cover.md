I've kinda always told myself that I would be uploading YouTube videos as regularly as I could. Well that never really happened, until today. I randomly woke up and felt like uploading one, which I did. A cover of Sauti Sol's song- Awinja. You can find it [here](https://youtu.be/ZbGrdmTI4sc). For this video I used, Cheese[some Linux webcam software], a C1U behringer microphone and the inbuilt laptop webcam[forgive the quality]. 

*[Edit: The audio's really crappy. I'll do a better job on my next video]*

Why this song? Well, for one, it's not because of the lovey dovey mapenzi innuendo it carries. It's because of _how_ it's played. Polycarp(the Sauti Sol Guitarist) uses african picking. African picking is where you use the thumb and the first finger[only] to generate some really cool sounds. That's why I love this song. It sounds really nice and has some chill African vibes[according to me] in it.

I figure I will be uploading more videos[not limited to music]. I really hope I can keep this going :)
