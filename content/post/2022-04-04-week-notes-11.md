This is the beginning of a new month, and with it,
here's a quote from a friend:

> Relationships are like plants. They need to be
> treated with care: Water them too much and you may
> damage them. Water them too little and they may
> dry up.

Here is another lovely one from [Nduli](https://jnduli.co.ke/) [adapted
from some book]:

> Do you know what's more dangerous than a villain?
> A villain who thinks they are a hero. A person
> like that, there's nothing they won't do, and they
> will always find themselves an excuse.
>
> Do you know what's more annoying than an ignorant
> person? An ignorant person who thinks they
> "know". Such a person will always come up with
> grandiose ideas founded on nothingness. And should
> such a person have the means, waste someone else's
> time in their pursuit of "nothingness".

Finally [wrt to quotes], here's one by Ralph Waldo
Emerson on making each day a masterpiece (from
[James] Clear's newsletter):

> Finish every day and be done with it. For manners
> and for wise living it is a vice to remember. You
> have done what you could; some blunders and
> absurdities no doubt crept in; forget them as soon
> as you can. Tomorrow is a new day; you shall begin
> it well and serenely, and with too high a spirit
> to be cumbered with your old nonsense. This day
> for all that is good and fair. It is too dear,
> with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment
> on the rotten yesterdays.


## Free And Open Source(FOSS) Work {#free-and-open-source--foss--work}

-   There's a _Pycon Kenya_ event coming up this
    month. I submitted a talk: "Managing Python
    Dependencies in GNU Guix" and it got accepted
    [here](https://sessionize.com/s/Munyoki/managing-python-dependencies-in-gnu-guix/49475). That said, for this event, I don't like
    that I had to create a "sessionize" account to
    submit a talk :(
-   Worked some more on the GNU Emacs' [tissue](https://tissue.systemreboot.net/)
    interface. Hopefully, I'll get something worth
    blogging about this week. In the meantime, I'll
    clean up that package and have my [team mates](https://issues.genenetwork.org/team.html) use
    it.
-   A team mate received an offer from
    industry. That's exciting news, and we wish him
    all the best :)


## Grad School {#grad-school}

-   Started writing my grant proposal for my
    Master's Programme disseration. You can view it
    [here](https://git.genenetwork.org/bonfacemunyoki/dissertation/src/branch/main/grant-proposal/grant-proposal.md). I want to finish it by the close of this
    week.
-   For some school syndicate group, we met up and
    tried to help one of our members with her
    project. I'll be doing less of this-- I have too
    much on my plate.
-   Last semester's results are out and I
    passed. Thus far, I've been consistent in my
    performance, and I want to keep things that way.


## Books {#books}

-   Made some progress with: "The Sense of Style" by
    Steven Pinker. At my current location in the
    book, Pinker is discussing some grammatical
    constructs. This section is making further
    progress with the book difficult.


## Personal &amp; Miscellaneous {#personal-and-miscellaneous}

-   Worked out issues with my partner. Key thing was
    _clear_ and _coherent_ communication.
-   Mental note to self: Consuming social media in
    any of its forms is not a form of entertainment.
-   Tasks-wise, I can only work on one major task in
    a day. The rest would just be "busy work".
-   Listened to Mike Kayihura's album: "Zuba".
-   Lights out this past (_entire_) weekend.
-   Fuel shortage here in Nairobi.
-   A recurring theme during some random hangout on
    Saturday: "What does friendship mean to you?"
-   How do you offer help and support to dear ones
    without imposing yourself or ideologies on them?
-   I trimmed down my GNU Emacs configs. I moved
    from "Helm" to "Vertico". At one point, I broke
    my configs and I spent some time
    trouble-shooting my GNU Emacs :(
-   In life, instead of "mindlessly" acting,
    consider first seeking out the right questions
    to ask. Then act by answering these
    questions. Life is easier and more fulfilling if
    you ask the "right" questions.
