Here are some things I noted down when researching how to de-clutter things, and make things more neater:

-   Get rid of things you don't need.
-   Take things one step at a time.
-   If cleaning things, maximise the number of surface areas.
-   Systematise things.
-   Control the flow of new things.
-   Create routines.
