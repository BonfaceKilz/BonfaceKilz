This is something I found from one of James Clear's newsletters:

The dynamic of friendship is almost always underestimated as a
constant force in human life: a diminishing circle of friends is the
first terrible diagnostic of a life in deep trouble: of overwork, of
too much emphasis on a professional identity, of forgetting who will
be there when our armored personalities run into the inevitable
natural disasters and vulnerabilities found in even the most average
existence...

The ultimate touchstone of friendship is not improvement, neither of
the other nor of the self, the ultimate touchstone is witness... to
have walked with them and to have believed in them, and sometimes just
to have accompanied them for however brief a span, on a journey
impossible to accomplish alone."
