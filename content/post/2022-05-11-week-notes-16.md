## Free And Open Source(FOSS) Work {#free-and-open-source--foss--work}

-   I gave a talk on: "Managing Python Dependencies
    in GNU Guix" in PyconKE 2022 held at USIU.
-   WRT GeneNetwork:
    -   I added some notes on editing case-attributes
        [here](https://issues.genenetwork.org/issues/edit-metadata-bugs.html) after a meeting with [Rob](https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/163/publications). He'll be going
        on holiday, and while he's away, I'll try to
        address every thing he raised in collaboration
        with other researchers.
    -   Merged [702](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/pull/702), [703](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/pull/703), and [#705](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/pull/705).


## Grad School {#grad-school}

-   I aced some CAT. Results came out and in the
    words of said lecturer: "Some gentleman
    submitted a professionally looking
    document". FWIW, I use orgmode and export
    documents to LaTeX.
-   Submitted, albeit hacky, some CAT solutions for
    some other unit (group work). This probably
    requires more work and a re-submission. I doubt
    I have the energy and mental band-width to make
    a significant contribution to the group.
-   It's exam month, so mental note to self: "Hack a
    way to make revising part of your routine."
-   Yet another take-away CAT handed out this week.
-   I hate R-Studio. It's such a pain and hassle to
    work with in terms of basically installing it in
    Arch Linux; and making it work in tandem with
    GNU Guix in it's package manager capacity. Last
    week, I spent way too much time trying to
    configure R-Studio. This was time poorly spent.


## Long Form Reading {#long-form-reading}

-   I made some progress in:
    -   Harville Hendrix' "Getting The Love You Want."
    -   BJ Fogg's "Tiny Habits."
-   Started reading: ""The Blade Itself".
-   Papers I started reading:
    -   Code Staging in GNU Guix by Ludovic Courtés.
    -   Functional Package Management with Guix by
        Ludovic Courtés.
    -   What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory
        by Ulrich Drepper.


## Personal &amp; Miscellaneous {#personal-and-miscellaneous}

-   I finally got around to deleting my Facebook
    account! Now, the only social media site I
    sparsely use is Twitter. Also, I've switched off
    mobile notifications for almost all of my apps
    on my android device. I genuinely believe that
    social media is bad for one's mental health.
-   I bought a squish ball and a "spinner" toy :)
-   Learnt how to use Emacs Embark.
-   Bought some art supplies; I intend to start
    sketching and painting.
-   I'm becoming better at managing my inner self;
    and also generally doing meaningful tasks, be
    they personal or (FOSS) work-related.,
-   I'm happy that I've been consistently
    meditating.
-   I installed qutebrowser as an alternative to
    Nyxt and Firefox. I'm still learning how to use
    it.
-   I set up Emms.
-   Watched the docu-series: "Why We Hate".
