Here's a lovely quote from one of James Clear's newsletters:

> There are many situations in life you do not control, but you
> often contribute to them.
>
> I cannot control the rain, but I can control my clothing.
>
> I cannot control your feelings, but I can control my kindness.
>
> I cannot control my opponent, but I can control my response.
>
> You cannot control most outcomes in life, but you can usually
> influence them.  Releasing your attachment to the results does not
> mean releasing your responsibility to the situation.
