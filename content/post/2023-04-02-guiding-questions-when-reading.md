Here are some useful set of questions you can ask yourself when reading something:

-   Who is speaking or writing?
-   What is their point of view or perspective?
-   What ideas and information are presented and how were they obtained?
-   Are there unsupported assertions?
-   Are relevant reasons or evidence provided?
-   Is the method used to find the evidence sound? (e.g. with regard to sample size or control group where statistical significance is claimed)
-   Is the evidence correct or valid?
-   What assumptions have been made?
-   What is fact and what is opinion?
-   What are the implicit and explicit values?
-   Are there unreasonable generalisations?
-   What has been omitted?
-   How were the conclusions reached?
-   Are the conclusions reasonable?
-   What other perspectives or points of view could there be?
