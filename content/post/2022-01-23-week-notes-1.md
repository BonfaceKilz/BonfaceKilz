## Free And Open Source(FOSS) Work {#free-and-open-source--foss--work}

-   I added some "README" to some school project which involves
    investigating body weight across several months of collected data.
    You can read more about it [here](https://github.com/BonfaceKilz/tsaf-analysis-of-bxd-mouse-colonies).  This should be updated to
    [genenetwork's](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2) list of jupyter notebooks that are self-hosted in some
    guix containers (I'll follow up with [jgarte](https://git.sr.ht/~whereiseveryone) on that regard).
-   Gave feedback on some Quality Control app for [genenetwork](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2).  My
    biggest concerns (no detailed explanations for now) were:
    -   Reducing (or altogether removing) the "util.py" file.
    -   Modularising the code for more re-use
-   There has been some progress by the gn2 team on self-hosting CI/ CD.
    Some of the notes are [here](https://github.com/genenetwork/gn-gemtext-threads/blob/main/topics/systems/ci-cd.gmi).  I am yet to catch up with this work.
-   Reviewed some PRs.
-   Tried to catch up with a tonne of e-mail ([notmuch](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/NotMuch) is really useful
    for this kind of stuff).
-   [jgarte](https://git.sr.ht/~whereiseveryone) had a proposal to demo `git rebase`.  I'll try to create a slot
    for that this week.


## Grad School {#grad-school}

-   I sat and made my final preparations for 3 papers:
    -   Principles Of Data Science (PDS)
    -   Optimisation for Data Science (ODS)
    -   Time Series And Forecasting (TSAF)

-   My exam was proctored at the office; since I am banned from campus
    because of my 3y+ dreadlocks which is banned (for males) en-campus.
    The proctoring experience was really nice.


## Books {#books}

-   A bit of Progress with "How to Read A Book".
-   I should consider replacing my "Kobo" with a "Kindle".  The user
    experience on Kobo is flaky.
-   Skimmed "Hands-On Data Analysis With Pandas" 2nd Ed.  I realise I'm
    green with pandas, but I'm not sure if it's something I'd like to be
    good at ;)


## Personal & Miscellaneous {#personal-and-miscellaneous}

-   Updated my keyboard layout for my TTY sessions to use Dvorak-p.  Read more [here](https://www.bonfacemunyoki.com/post/2021-01-13-updating-keyboard-layout-of-a-tty-screen/).
-   Renewed my FastMail subscription for this coming year.
-   Paid my older [sibling](https://jnduli.co.ke/) amounts owed on ledger.  I need to balance my
    ledger some time this coming week.
-   Accompanied my partner for some eye check-up.
-   Used the [Cornell Note Taking System](https://lsc.cornell.edu/how-to-study/taking-notes/cornell-note-taking-system/) in my Bullet Journal while
    revising for my finals.  I'll do more of this.
-   Finished watching Marvel's "What If..." during one of my day's
    wind-ups.
-   Watched the 2 episodes of "Shikkakumon no Saikyou Kenja".
-   Went to some event my friend was organising on Saturday night to
    offer a shoulder of support for his endeavour.  Empty, but nice set
    of DJs.
-   Got sick(annoying cough that prevented me from sleeping well).
    Doctors say it's a mixture of an allergic reaction; and a "light"
    infection.  Got some medication for that.
-   Some nice quote my [partner](https://www.behance.net/nkarira654b) shared with me:

    > Psychology studies show that when participants are given something new
    > to learn, focusing on the journey rather than the outcome appears to
    > improve both enjoyment and attention, two things associated with
    > high-quality learning.  If you find yourself framing learning as a
    > burdensome investment that pays off later, try to flip your thinking
    > and focus on enjoying the learning itself, right now.
