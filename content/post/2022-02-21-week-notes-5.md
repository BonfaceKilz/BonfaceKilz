## Free And Open Source(FOSS) Work {#free-and-open-source--foss--work}

-   Open Question: how can you capture changes in MariaDb
    programmatically?
-   Read up on [EdgeDB 1.0](https://www.edgedb.com/blog/edgedb-1-0) and came up with a rough outline of how to go
    about testing it's performance against Virtuoso and MariaDB for
    graph-like data.
-   Online Guix Day Conference 2022 happened over the weekend!  Full
    talks [here](https://guix.gnu.org/blog/2022/online-guix-days-2022-announcement-2/).  I want to be more active both in the [whereiseveryone](https://git.sr.ht/~whereiseveryone/)
    and Guix communities.
-   For Genenetwork2 work, I can now successfully export case attribute
    date if they exist.  See the draft PR [here](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork3/pull/77).  In the process, I fixed
    an unnoticed bug where duplicate entries were being fetched.
    Queries dropped from ~16s to less than 1s!  This week I want to
    extend that PR to have edits, deletions and insertions and hopefully
    have people test it out by Friday.
-   Conversations with [Jonathan McHugh](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/speaker/jonathan%5Fmchugh/) on knowledge management on
    Gemini, in addition to other personal conversation.  This coming
    weeks I want to spare consistent hours a week to just work on some
    gemini stuff.  I'll define "stuff" as time goes by.
-   I added [org-time-budgets](https://github.com/BonfaceKilz/emacs.d/commit/354b2cf78ad3a858fe5d26b385d85a43a3783ee4); so now major tags in my org file have time
    budgets per week.  A nice simple bar appears in my org agenda.  I
    had to trim down my org-file to make my agenda generation faster.


## Grad School {#grad-school}

-   Made significant strides in group term paper.
-   School work.  Not much to say about this.


## Long Form Reading {#long-form-reading}

-   Some progress in: "Bad Science"
-   Finished the Manhwa: Solo-levelling!  I strongly recommend this.
-   Started the manga: "Sakamoto Days".


## Personal & Miscellaneous {#personal-and-miscellaneous}

-   Found out I'm pre-diabetic. Reversible; so I have to change my
    life-style: mindful eating and exercise.  This really threw me off a
    bit work-wise.
-   Started jogging in the mornings.
-   Bought myself a fancy fountain pen(I journal a lot(!) in cursive).
    Bad decision this one.  The pen is heavy and slippery to the touch.
    Also, it doesn't seem to ink well with Pelican 4001 "Brilliant
    Schwarz Brilliant Black".
