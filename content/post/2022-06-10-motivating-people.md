Today, I came across this interesting quote from
James Clear's newsletter:

> Lillian Moore shares a quick story that reveals
> what really motivates people:
>
> "A few months after my husband and I moved to a
> small Massachusetts town I grumbled to a resident
> about the poor service at the library, hoping she
> would repeat my complaints to the librarian. The
> next time I went to the library, the librarian had
> set aside two bestsellers for me and a new
> biography for my husband. What's more, she
> appeared to be genuinely glad to see me.
>
> Later I reported the miraculous change to my
> friend. "I suppose you told her how poor we
> thought the service was?" I asked.
>
> "No," she confessed. "In fact—I hope you don't
> mind—I told her your husband was amazed at the way
> she had built up this small town library, and that
> you thought she showed unusually good taste in the
> new books she ordered."

Being _[overly]_ critical has a counter-intuitive
effect of making people _defensive_, and as such,
leads to unproductive
situations/encounters. Similarly, when talking to
people, care should be taken not to be _toxically_
positive. Generally, be a nice person, and try to
make that come from a genuine place. People tend
to reciprocate the energy you give out.
