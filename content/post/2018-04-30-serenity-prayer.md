I found this prayer [here](http://reverentgeek.com/developers-serenity-prayer/ "serenity prayer").

```
Oh Great Cloud,

Grant me the courage to write the code I can,
to escalate the tickets I cannot fix,
and the wisdom to know the difference.

Programming one day at a time,
enjoying one function at a time;
accepting bugs as a pathway to code complete;
taking this terrible codebase as it is;
not as I would have it;
trusting that all things will be made right
if I surrender to writing tests and documentation;
so that I may be reasonably happy at the end of the day
and somewhat sane at the end of this release.

Amen
```
