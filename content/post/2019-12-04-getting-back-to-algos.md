I'm not a big fan of algorithms, at least not in the sense of the dry computer scienc-ish way it's usually presented at some learning institutions. However, these past few days, I have come to appreciate the value of being able to solve algo questions because of the interview process at some companies.

At some companies, passing algos is a hard requirement. Well, I reckon I'll create a simple routine for practising a bunch of algo questions in addition to hacking around some things I like(Haskell/ Elm/ Emacs/ Lisp \m/\m/)
