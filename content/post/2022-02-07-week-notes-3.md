## Free And Open Source(FOSS) Work {#free-and-open-source--foss--work}

-   Thanks to [Pjotr](https://thebird.nl/), we now have a new issue tracker hosted in
    gemini (gemini://thebird.nl/gn-gemtext-threads/README.gmi).  You have
    to use a gemini client to view that.  You can use a proxy to view
    that content e.g. [here](http://gemini.thebird.nl/gemini/genenetwork/gn-gemtext-threads/README.gmi)
-   New issues assigned to me.  Once I finish [this](https://github.com/genenetwork/gn-gemtext-threads/blob/main/topics/data-uploads/reverse-from-file.gmi) task I'll work on
    them:
    -   <https://github.com/genenetwork/gn-gemtext-threads/tree/main/issues/gnbug>
    -   <https://github.com/genenetwork/gn-gemtext-threads/blob/main/issues/gnbug/hide-stale-issues.gmi>
-   Understood what Cross-Reference tables are and how they are used in
    the context of genenetwork2.  The `caseattribute` cross reference
    table stores tho case attribute data for samples.  I should document
    this somewhere.
-   Created a [BBB](https://meet.nixnet.services/b) room to host genetics101: An entry level presentation
    on genetics and what [genenetwork](http://genenetwork.org/) does for contributors without any
    biology or genetics background.  The most important thing I got out
    of this presentation was the "2 hand model of genetics".
-   Reviewed:
    -   <https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/pull/664>
    -   <https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/pull/660>

    -   <https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork3/pull/76>
-   Fixed a serious bug in [genenetwork3](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork3/commit/710769e84b3bc6a2bdd66effdbac0659272ed511) [here](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork3/commit/710769e84b3bc6a2bdd66effdbac0659272ed511).
-   Use: `M-x toggle-truncate-lines` in GNU Emacs to toggle wrapping of
    long lines.
-   Genenetwork services, IIUC were out because of some sand-storm.
-   As usual, cleared a bunch of e-mails.  The "Art of Nonviolent
    Communication" proved resourceful in how I communicate nowadays.
-   FOSSDEM 2022 happened.  I hanged out at the [Declarative and Minimalistic Computing devroom](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/track/declarative%5Fand%5Fminimalistic%5Fcomputing/).
-   Hanged out with [Jgart](https://git.sr.ht/~whereiseveryone) and discussed a bunch of work issues.  The
    next hang-out will be a pairing session.
