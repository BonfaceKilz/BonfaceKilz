Here's an excerpt from James Clear's newsletter:

> Life presents an endless series of interruptions and
> distractions.
>
> You will continually be pulled off course or asked to put out a
> fire created by someone else. People will disrespect your time
> and steal your attentionâ€”usually with no intention of malice, but
> simply because different people have different priorities.
>
> When your day is interrupted or your progress stalls, it's easy
> for your mindset to collapse as well. You may feel guilty for not
> following through on what you intended to do. But you are not
> guilty, you are human.
>
> Everyone gets distracted. In many ways, the real divide is
> between those who get back on track quickly and those who let
> interruptions expand into longer periods of inactivity.
>
> Top performers get back on track faster than most. This is the
> skill to develop. You will be interrupted, but you can choose to
> keep it brief.
