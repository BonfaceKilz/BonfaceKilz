This year has been difficult for me for reasons that deserve a post of
it's own.  This has led me down a path of occasional sub-optimal
performance in my job, and personal life too.  It has taken me some
time to get my act together; and work out how to deal with stress and
worry-some situations.  Meditation, reading, close people and honest
conversations with my internal being/ self has helped me develop an
always evolving WIP framework for dealing with situations which make
me feel anxious and/ or overwhelmed.  Below I outline this framework
for dealing with worry-some situations:

1.  Describe your _feelings_.  Articulate what you _feel_, not what you
    _think_.  A big help for this has been referencing the [feelings
    wheel](https://blog.calm.com/blog/the-feelings-wheel) to help me articulate how I feel, and if necessary, how to
    communicate these feelings(using [NVC](https://www.cnvc.org/learn-nvc/what-is-nvc)) to myself, and if necessary,
    other people in a way that articulates my needs clearly.
2.  Get the facts in an impartial way.  **Writing** down these facts is
    an important step, since it makes something that seems abstract
    more concrete.
3.  Analyse the aforementioned facts.  Some useful questions I use are:
    -   Given these facts, what's the worst that could happen?
    -   How do I feel about this?  Again, use the [feelings wheel](https://blog.calm.com/blog/the-feelings-wheel) to help
        with this.
4.  Finally, make a decision based off these facts.  **Act** on your decision.  Do something about it!

These steps have really helped me deal with anxiety-inducing
situations in a much more productive way.  I write this, primarily for
myself to reference later, and hopefully help some random person out
there.
