I'm writing this on 2018-08-09 at 00:26 hours. Well, needless to say, I'm beat. I've been swamped with emergency tasks the whole day. That aside,yesterday in the evening, I decided to sit down and do some interviews with this new start up called Safi Analytics. I'm guessing this is the first round pick. This post is a my brief experience regarding this process, my opinions, and somethings I'm upto.

Objectively speaking, the interview questions were quite fair(and simple)- compared to implementing darn BCH/ Convolution codes. However, this process highlighted a flaw in how I think and work- which is a nice thing I guess. I need to get more comfortable with "competitive" programming- you know, the kind where you are given a bunch of questions(sometimes within a given time frame). It unsettling when you try to figure out why this does not work: `f"Some really long url {myCustomData}"` only to realize 15 minutes in that you are running goddamn Archlinux and have Python 3.6.5. *f-strings* don't work in earlier versions of Python. Another weird thing: when you are used to using some specific libraries e.g. `requests` as opposed to the more "default" `urllib` to make API requests, you waste alot of time. All in all, I think I performed poorly- I'll improve on this later.

I've spent the past 6 months doing maintenance work(basically damage control) on a badly designed system. Other than that, I've spent a significant amout of time doing me some digital image processing and learning tenets of functional programming in Haskell. All this stuff don't cut it in competitive programming kind of things, which Hackerrank (more or less) is. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this stuff is bad; More like an ambitious dev out there needs to be more comfortable with some of these things.

I'll start doing more of these coding challenges. I'll kinda however prioritize Project Euler over the rest(Hackerrank and Kattis). My goal for now is to be able to express myself fluently in whatever problem domain I find myself in. 

My goals for now? Well:
+ Be really good in solving problems using the the Functional Paradigm(preferrably Haskell) and apply it in almost everything I do
+ Work remotely/ of full time(as long as it's not based in SF) for a company that uses FP in their operations and dev work
+ Get deep into some codecs
+ Kernel ninja/ systems(as in Linux) hacker
+ More kernel/ linux hacking
+ Be a decent SRE(or understand principles underlying it)
+ Deep understanding of some wireless telecomm systems

Here are books I'm reading:
+ Learn you a Haskell(Halfway done)

Here are books a devOps guy shared(what he plans on reading):
+ Designing Data Intensive Applications
+ The Site Reliability Workbook
+ Thinkos

Here are books I plan on reading:
+ Reall world haskell
+ Cloud Native Computing Computing With Go

What I'm doing:
+ Remote Work at CHAI
+ Porting some ANPR system to Haskell
+ Preparing a white paper on the above

I guess, I'll go to sleep now. Hope for a better day tomorrow :)
