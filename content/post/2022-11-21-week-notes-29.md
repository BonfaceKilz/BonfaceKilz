This review is yet another monthly review.  I'm glad that I'm finally
able to write this.  Here's a quote on becoming an outlier:

> The first step - perhaps the most enormous step - is to find what you
> are genuinely interested in.
>
> If you are genuinely interested, you will discover endless
> opportunities for improvement. But if you are disinterested, even
> obvious improvements will feel like a chore.
>
> And, if you can maintain your genuine interest and curiosity as the
> years accumulate, you will become hard to compete with because you
> will have skill to go with your passion. If you're interested, you're
> dangerous.

After some deep thinking, the values most important to me ATM are:
selfless honesty, compassion, patience, and gracefulness.


## Free and Open Source (FOSS) Work {#free-and-open-source--foss--work}

-   I got merge access to all of [Nairobi LUG's](https://github.com/nairobilug) repositories.
-   Booked a flight to attend FOSDEM 2023 (February) in Brussels.
    Booking a flight is [risky but] cheaper.
-   In Genenetwork2, I merged: [#738](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/pull/738), [#743](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/pull/743), [#744](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/pull/744) [#745](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/pull/745), and [#747](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/pull/747)
-   In Genenetwork3, I merged: [#101](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork3/pull/101) and [#104](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork3/pull/104).


## Grad School {#grad-school}

-   Sat for my module 4 exams.  They went well.
-   It took some time for SU to receive funds for my grant.  No one's to
    blame except the institution's bureaucratic processes.  Also, mad
    shout out to the course administrator.  She's a god-send.
-   Started module 5 (the second-last module left before I finish my masters).


## Long Form Reading {#long-form-reading}

-   Made good progress with:
    -   A Philosophy of Software Design.
    -   The Art of Non-Violent Communication.
-   [[Paper] The Friendship Paradox: statistically, your friends are more popular than you are](https://fermatslibrary.com/s/why-your-friends-have-more-friends-than-you-do)


## Personal &amp; Miscellaneous {#personal-and-miscellaneous}

-   Replaced my national ID.
-   You only have 2 lives.  And the second one begins when you realize
    that you only have one.
-   Find the intersection of what you like; what you can be good at; and
    what the world values.
-   Deleted my ex-partner's number.  Otherwise, I'd call them
    impulsively; and I reckon that's not good for either of us.
-   Started the process of applying for a Schengen visa to travel to
    Brussels for FOSDEM 2023 in February.
-   I bought a new laptop: ThinkPad Carbon (4th Generator) with 16 GiB
    RAM and 512 GiB SSD.
-   Manga Recommendatian: sunken-rock
-   Keep ignoring feedback and life will keep teaching you the same
    lesson.
-   Poet and author Annie Dillard on the value of a schedule: "How we
    spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives. What we do
    with this hour, and that one, is what we are doing. A schedule
    defends from chaos and whim. It is a net for catching days."
-   The benefits that arise from a good relationship—whether it be in
    marriage, friendship, business, or otherwise—are often produced over
    a long time span.  Is it more important to win this battle or to
    maintain this relationship?
-   Not sure where I read/heard this: "I have everything I need for
    now. I do not need another person to complete or sustain me. I am
    happy and fulfilled. I may meet someone who will make me happier
    than I am today. Meanwhile, I will enjoy what I have today," she
    once told me.  She is decent and happily single, and it is her
    choice.
-   I'm not hurt, I'm healing.  I'm not losing, I'm learning.  I was not
    rejected, I was redirected.  Negative things happen.  Negative
    mindsets make them harder.
-   The more prepared person usually wins.  You get credit for action,
    not preparation.
-   On productivity/scaling: "One of the common trappings of success is
    overproducing.  Companies make money and rapidly expand their
    product line.  Authors become popular and churn out books at a
    faster clip.  Scale can empower, but it can also dilute. Something
    is lost when quantity is valued over quality.  You have to maintain
    your standards even when all the forces around you seem to be
    calling for growth. Push back against more, more, more and remain
    committed to better, better, better."
