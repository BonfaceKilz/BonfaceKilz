This week's been really crappy; I've suffered from some really bad flu which has taken it's toll on me. Anyway, today I was going through the NAILUG mailing list and I came across some very interesting [post](URL https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/nairobi-gnu/_Z4_SBzmU_0) that involved some tool, Radicale, which can be used for calendar and contact storage. This project is open source and actively maintained. I've always wanted to sync all my todolists(I use task warrior for this) and financial tracking stuff(LedgerCLI) across my multiple devices. Radicale appears to be very promising. I'll definitely have a deeper look into its docs this weekend. You can find their website [here](http://radicale.org/URL ).
