Here are some useful notes on how to report bugs in a useful way:

-   What are you trying to do?  Give the maintainers some context by letting them know why.
    -   useful to avoid the [XY problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem) - situations where the question is about an end user's attempted solution (Y) rather than the root problem itself (X).
    -   give the other person enough context to help you.
-   Tell them what you did:
    -   tell them the versions of the things you're using.
    -   tell them what you ran.
-   Tell them what you expected to see: outputs, side-effects, etc.
-   Tell them what happened: outputs, crash reports etc
-   (Optional) Minimize your reproduction - only mention relevant steps for reproduction:
    -   useful to eliminate a lot of noise.
    -   narrow to exactly your problem.
-   (Debugging) Dive into the code yourself and report your findings.
