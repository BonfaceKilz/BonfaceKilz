[Four years ago](https://www.bonfacemunyoki.com/post/2018-12-14-switching-to-programmers-dvorak/), I made the switch from the standard QWERTY keyboard layout to the [Dvorak-P](https://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/index.html) layout. It was a difficult transition at first, but I was determined to experiment and see if it could improve my typing speed and efficiency.  Fast forward to today, and I can confidently say that the switch to Dvorak-P was a decent one. My typing speed has increased dramatically, and I [very importantly] no longer have to worry about those pesky finger cramps that used to plague me.

But not everyone was on board with my decision. In fact, some people thought I was absolutely crazy for even considering it. They said things like, "Why would you do that to yourself?" and "You're never going to be able to use other people's computer again!" Well, I'm here to tell you that - except for the latter - those naysayers were dead wrong. I may have had a few rough days at the beginning, but now I can type faster and more accurately than ever before.  And let me tell you, there's nothing quite like the feeling of being able to out-type all of your QWERTY-using friends. It's like a secret superpower that only a select few possess.  Of course if you use QWERTY, you could catch up with mad practice ;)

So if you're thinking about making the switch to Dvorak, don't let anyone stop you. It may be a little challenging at first, but trust me, it's worth it. Plus, you'll be able to join the elite group of Dvorak[-P] users and lord your superior typing skills over all the QWERTY peasants.

Dvorak[-P] for the win!
