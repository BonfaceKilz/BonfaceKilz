Here's a little snippet from the book "How to Read a Book" that I
liked, and think that applies to many things: When you claim that you
understand something but you disagree, it means that:

-   You are un-informed; or
-   You are mis-informed; or
-   Your reasoning is not congent - illogical; or
-   Your analysis is incomplete.
