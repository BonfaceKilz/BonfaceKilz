This has been a slow week for me :(

That said, here be a deep verse from Kendrick
Lamar's "The Heart Part 5" in the persona of the
Nipsey Hussle:

> And to my neighbourhood, let the good prevail;
> Make sure them babies and the leaders outta jail;
> Look for salvation when troubles get real;
> 'Cause you can't help the world until you help yourself;
> And I can't blame the hood the day that I was killed;
> Y'all had to see it, that's the only way to feel;
> And though my physical won't reap the benefits;
> The energy that carry on emits still;
> I want you


## Free And Open Source(FOSS) Work {#free-and-open-source--foss--work}

-   I've been working on allowing specific curators
    to make edits to case-attributes in
    [GeneNetwork](http://genenetwork.org/). The tricky thing for me has been to
    create a decent UI/UX experience that allows for
    curation. I'm in the process of refactoring my
    WIP code to replace Redis with SQL wrt storing
    previous edits.
-   Meeting with one of our users to discuss the
    above.


## Grad School {#grad-school}

-   Took one day off to finish and submit some
    pending CAT.
-   This is the final week of class. Next week is
    study week, and thereafter my finals for this
    module.


## Long Form Reading {#long-form-reading}

-   Started: "Essentialism" by Greg McKeown.
-   I consistently read: Tiny Habits.


## Personal &amp; Miscellaneous {#personal-and-miscellaneous}

-   My website has been down since Saturday. This
    was because I could not use my credit card to
    pay for my instance hosted at [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/en/).
-   I got a Sheafer pen; and I'm in love with the
    experience. Flourishing your cursive makes it
    more beautiful ;)
-   Kendrick Lamar's song: "The Heart Part 5"; and
    his album: "Mr. Morale &amp; The Big Steppers" is
    really dope and insightful.
