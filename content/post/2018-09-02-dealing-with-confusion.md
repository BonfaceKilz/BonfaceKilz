A lot of times in life, we are placed in situations where we really do not know what to do. Such situations can be called "confusing". Well, a simple way to overcome this would be to first to try to *identify* what aspect of the problem is confusing. Identifying, or trying to identify the problem forces you to think about the problem in a deeper level. This step can be really hard, since you might be forced to think about some really uncomfortable things, perharps the kind of things that make you feel all eeky on the inside.

Once you've identified the problem, you can now have a sense of direction in tackling the problem. If it's a problem that may involve finding the solution, you could now identigy gaps in your own knowledge and now seek to fill those gaps. if it's a social problem, you can seek professional help or maybe do your own research on how to solve that problem.
