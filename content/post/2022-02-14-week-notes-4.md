## Free And Open Source(FOSS) Work {#free-and-open-source--foss--work}

-   Merged:
    -   <https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork3/pull/76>
    -   <https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/pull/660>
-   Created this handy snip for starting all the genenetwork services
    within tmux (`rungn2` and `runproxy` start some genenetwork specific
    services):

    ```sh
      #!/bin/sh

      tmux new-session -s gn2 'herd start redis; runproxy' \; \
           split-window 'rungn2' \;
    ```
-   I reproduced some errors regarding "zeros" and modifying data.
    Fixed them here:
    -   [834821b](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork3/commit/834821b086d6a963b60bddb4bf41aee94af5f0db)
    -   [63716e1](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork3/commit/63716e121e0b546b158acd27349eae187546e7cc)
    -   [34aa1f0](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork3/commit/34aa1f04ded87af501bb34ecdd5937e082c010f6)
-   Finally created correct case-attribute queries(for genenetwork2) to
    fetch data for sample data.
-   [Pjotr](https://thebird.nl/) was around.  A lot of answers around [inserting case-attribute
    data](http://gemini.thebird.nl/gemini/genenetwork/gn-gemtext-threads/topics/data-uploads/inserting-data.gmi) in genenetwork2 were answered.
-   Attended some talk with [Prof. S](https://www.shelbydarnell.com/) and [Pjotr](https://thebird.nl/) at ICIPE.  I learnt many
    things related with Biology.  I also met some cool people doing
    really cool research work.


## Grad School {#grad-school}

-   Module 3 started.
-   Researched how to write a Literature Review
-   Little progress in term paper.


## Books {#books}

-   New book: "Gift-ology" by John Ruhlin added to my queue.
-   Made some progress in: "How To Read A Book".
-   New book recommendation: "Being You: A New Science of Consciousness"
-   Some book I should put high on my reading list: "The Book Of Why" by
    Judea Pearl.


## Personal & Miscellaneous {#personal-and-miscellaneous}

-   Created my February Budget; all inside my Bullet Journal.
-   Started maintaining a spending log in my Bullet Journal; it's a
    simple table with four columns: Date, Description, Source and Cost.
-   I had irregular sleep patterns last week.  I'll need to try to be
    consistent with waking up at 5 AM :).
-   Some head hunter reached out to me trying to recruit(not me) a
    tech-lead at a local start-up at Nairobi Garage: [elewa](https://elewa.co.ke/).  Gave them
    my 2Â¢.
-   My partner's birthday.  I felt out of place at the
    "friends-and-some-family" gathering.  People were talking about
    clothes, fashion, run-ways, etc etc.  Not my cup of tea.
-   I want to create my own routine on doing algorithms and exploring
    code.  Note for interviews, but because it's fun!
