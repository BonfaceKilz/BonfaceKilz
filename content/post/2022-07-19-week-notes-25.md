## Free And Open Source (FOSS) Work {#free-and-open-source--foss--work}

-   I've cut down on watching media that's designed to take advantage of users' finite attention span.
    That said, I've substituted watching youtube and/or browsing social media with reading Mailing Lists.
    Whenever I can, I offer suggestions, reviews or even patches.
    ATM, I've been intrigued by the ongoing [retbleed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retbleed) discussion in the Linux Kernel mailing lists.
-   I just sent a patch to [Arun](https://www.systemreboot.net/) for some csv parsing work I did.
    I implemented that with continuations in a very bare-bones way.
    A better library was recommended: [guile-dsv - Delimiter-separated values (DSV) format parser for GNU Guile](https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/guile-dsv/).
    I want to send V2 patches with the above changes + some logic for dumping SQL.
-   This week, I want have my SQL patchset reviewed and hopefully reviewed.
    While the test-window is present, I want to see if I can merge [this](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork3/pull/96) or at the very least make some progress on it.
-   WRT GN2/3 I reckon I'm well positioned to lead the back-end engineering effort.
    On that front, over the coming weeks I'll work out a way to be more aggressive on that front.
    One thing I'll do is come up with a plan - that aligns - with my school work on how to go about this.


## Grad School {#grad-school}

-   I got to hang-out with a class mate where I reviewed some take-away CAT.
    I learnt some new things and made corrections to my submissions.
    Got an anime - OT for this section - recommendation: "My Isekai Life."
-   Last semester's results have been published in our portal, and I "generally" passed.
    Only thing that concerns me is that I have a "retake" for one of the units I took last semester.
    The grades - for this retake - haven't been published, so this may be a case of missing results.
    That said, my reaction to this was very "panicky" - an indicator to myself that somewhere inside me, despite alot of effort against it, I still attach alot of value to academic accomplishment at the expense of real intellectual pursuit (see: [On learning and being present](https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-06-25-knowledge-presence/) on further discussion of this, in particular "avatars".)
    Also, I noticed that I am cognizant of some "pride" in myself - I think, to some extent, that I'm too "smart" to fail an SU exam.
    This "pride" stems from a place of "repulsion/hate/anger" of the institution itself since (one of) my first (and memorable) experiences there was some random staff (fashion police) harassing me.
    I'm proud of myself that I can have these conversations with myself in a very honest way.
    Humility and honesty are some important qualities I've observed in researchers I look upto.
    I've already raised my concerns to the department for them to take action.
    Also, I'll try to reach out to the individual lecturer, and find out what/where I did wrong - not to "fix" things, but more for myself to understand what I could have done better.


## Long Form Reading {#long-form-reading}

-   Read the paper: [On learning and being present | Protesilaos Stavrou](https://protesilaos.com/books/2022-06-25-knowledge-presence/).
    I highly recommend this, you much gain to by understanding Prot's points.
-   Finished Chapter 1 of SICP.
-   Made some progress with "All About Love" by Bell Hooks.
-   Started reading the [FHS (File Hierarchy) standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard).


## Personal &amp; Miscellaneous {#personal-and-miscellaneous}

-   I created my very first source hut [repository](https://git.sr.ht/~bonfacekilz/algos).
    With time, I intend to move most - if not all - of my repositories from Github to [sourcehut](https://sourcehut.org/).
-   Hanged out with a dear one - they are going through alot - on Friday at some oontz space (Mist).
    The hangout was something akin to moral/emotional support.
    In the process, I got to have a random hang-out with some other person.
    The experience was really nice.
-   Bought an extra - yay! - heater for the host.
    This cold Nairobi weather can be unbearable at times.
-   On Sunday, I reconnected with an old friend who's in Germany atm.
    We caught up on so many fronts.
-   Quality time with my baby sister.
-   My partner went to the Coast.
    I wish I could join them.
-   [Burna Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burna_Boy) dropped a new album: [Love, Damini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love,_Damini).
    I generally like it - worth a listen.
-   Replaced my ink cartridge - nowadays I print alot!
    There was a bit of a hassle where one of the new catridges I bought was damaged.
    I returned it to the vendor - TBC Sarit Center - and they replaced it without any trouble.  Big up to them!
-   Coming weekends, I want to put more time in: [nairobilug/bingwa-wa-ufundi: NairobiLUG's Guix channel](https://github.com/nairobilug/bingwa-wa-ufundi).
