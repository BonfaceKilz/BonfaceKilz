Reading can be passive; or it can be active. It all depends on how you
want to engage with the book. It's an important trait to cultivate
"curiosity" around what you consume. To help out with that, you could ask yourself these questions:

-   What are the key ideas?
-   How can I apply this knowledge that I've just learnt?
-   How does this relate to what I already know?
