I got this error sometime today after doing a system upgrade:

> Your Computer Clock is Wrong
>
> Your computer thinks it is 6/2/2022, which prevents Firefox from connecting securely. To visit www.youtube.com, update your computer clock in your system settings to the current date, time, and time zone, and then refresh www.youtube.com.
>
> www.youtube.com has a security policy called HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), which means that Firefox can only connect to it securely. You canâ€™t add an exception to visit this site.

I fixed it by running:

```text
sudo timedatectl set-ntp true
```
