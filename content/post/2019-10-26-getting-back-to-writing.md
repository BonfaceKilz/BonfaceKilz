It's been a while since I posted something here. I've been busy with life :(
Well this post does 2 things:

-   It's a personal note to self that I should get back to this space
-   A simple test for some travis build I set up :)

With regards to writing articles, I intend to be more active and write more
about functional programming, Emacs/ Org mode, my experience at work and other
miscellaneous topics around work. My motivation for getting back to writing is
that I'd want to improve at writing. Also, writing about things I care about
will hopefully make me understand <span class="underline">why</span> I do the things I do. I reckon knowing
why you do things helps you in tackling how to do things in addition to helping
you remain consistent in doing said things.
