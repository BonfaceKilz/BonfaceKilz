Writing reviews can be a huge time sink, especially if you do alot of reading. Instead of writing full reviews, I will be posting a list of books I have read or re-read, once in a couple of months. Each list item will be accompanied by a very short review(a few sentences at most). Some books that lie on extremes, either too good or too bad, will warrant a full review.

Here are the books I've read in the August - November 2017 time period:

+ "Fahrenheit 451" by Ray Bradbury- A classic dystopian novel of a post-literate future. Fun to read.
+ "The Four Thousand, the Eight Hundred" by Greg Egan- A short sci-fi novella based in space. Quick read.
+ "The Art of Unix Programming" by ESR- I will reread this and write a full review. A must read for any linux enthusiast out there.
+ "Transhuman" by Mark L. and Van Name- A collection of short stories with hardcore tech as the common theme. A really enjoyable read.
+ "A Mind at Play" by Jimmy Soni- A book that chronicles the life of Claude Shannon. I really enjoyed this book. It clearly explains the context behind some really wonderful technologies, like encoding, that we enjoy today.
+ "Thinking in Systems: A primer" by Donella Meadows- An introduction to systems thinking for laymen. I love how how the author ties system-thinking concepts to our lives. This has had an impact on how I see the world. I will write a full review later.
+ "Math, Better Explained" by Kalid Azad- A book that seeks to make Math fun "again". Really relevant to High School students or introductory Math courses. Beyond that, it may provide some intuition behind some things like complex numbers, but nothing more.
