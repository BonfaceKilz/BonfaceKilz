New month! This month I want to focus on living a
more balanced, mindful and self-aware
life. Instead of focusing on things to do, I want
to focus more on the behaviours that can get
things done; and possibly turn those behaviours
into habits.


## Free And Open Source(FOSS) Work {#free-and-open-source--foss--work}

-   Finished an submitted my [grant-proposal](https://github.com/BonfaceKilz/dissertation/blob/main/grant-proposal/grant-proposal.org) which
    aligns to GN.
-   Tip for deleting merged branches from Magit:
    Type: \`y y - M y\`
-   Some meeting notes [here](https://issues.genenetwork.org/issues/edit-metadata-bugs.html).


## Grad School {#grad-school}

-   Sat for an exam on some course in Advanced
    Bio-informatics.
-   Exam month.


## Books {#books}

-   I made some progress in:
    -   "Team of Rivals."
    -   BJ Fogg's "Tiny Habits."
    -   Harville Hendrix' "Getting The Love You Want."


## Personal &amp; Miscellaneous {#personal-and-miscellaneous}

-   There was a 5 day long holiday that started on
    Friday and lasted upto Tuesday.
-   Finally got around to turning all my app and
    browser notifications off. I browse the web with
    JavaScript off. I need to do more work to turn
    it on. I'm having more sane and peaceful days. ;)
-   I set-up [org-citar](https://github.com/bdarcus/citar).
-   Spent some time with family and friends over the
    weekend with little internet access somewhere in
    Nakuru. This period was such a "mindful"
    experience and I came off it
    well-rested. Getting back to Nairobi was such a
    hassle! The traffic!!!
-   System upgrade(both Guix and Arch Linux); and my
    external USB microphone no longer works. :(
-   I resumed meditating every morning.
-   I'm becoming more self-aware as a person.


## Link Roundup {#link-roundup}

-   [Tools for a culture of writing](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31163877)
-   [The Deadly Accordion Wars of Lesotho](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-61097386)
