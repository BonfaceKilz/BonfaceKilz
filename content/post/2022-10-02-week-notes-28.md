This review is more of a monthly review since I never had the mental
capacity to write weekly reviews consistently - yet again, this month
has been tough on me and at one point I crashed.  That said, here's a
good piece of advice I got from someone I respect:

> You have a lot on your plate.  I know that.  The trick behind
> achieving is to focus on the IMPORTANT things only.  I know it is not
> always fun, but I am sure your look back fondly on this period.  It
> actually does not get better or easier.  With age you just get better
> at picking the right things to do.

After some deep thinking, the values most important to me ATM are:
selfless honesty, compassion, patience, and gracefulness.


## Free and Open Source (FOSS) Work {#free-and-open-source--foss--work}

-   Got rid of MySQLAchemy dependency in [#730](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/pull/730).  Here's the associated issue tracker: [Replace sqlalchemy with MySQLdb](https://issues.genenetwork.org/issues/sqlalchemy).
-   I attempted to fix some broken correlations in [#732](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/pull/732).
-   Currently working on: [Annotate traits page with metadata from RDF](https://issues.genenetwork.org/issues/add-metadata-to-traits-page).  Here's the design doc: [Add Metadata To The Trait Page (RDF)](https://issues.genenetwork.org/topics/add-metadata-to-trait-page).
-   Filed a new bug report [here](https://issues.genenetwork.org/issues/error-when-fetching-snps). If/When I get the band-width, assuming
    my team-mate won't have time to work on it, I'll go ahead and
    resolve this.
-   I started slowly learning the workings of the Linux Kernel at my own
    pace; and consequently some C programming.
-   Explored Federated Queries in the context of Genenetwork.  In one
    demo I gave, I gave a crap example :(
-   I've started preparing for a trip to Brussels for FOSDEM 2023.  ATM
    this involves: booking a flight and applying for a visa in good
    time.
-   Be careful when using "readability" as an excuse for changing a
    piece of code - that's a personal opinion/preference.
-   I finally got access-writes to the Nairobi LUG's repositories on
    GitHub.  I merged: [#5](https://github.com/nairobilug/bingwa-wa-ufundi/pull/5).  I reviewed: [#1](https://github.com/nairobilug/lug-logolatte/pull/1).  I've also started a
    conversation on adding a Code of Conduct.  You can read it [here](https://groups.google.com/g/nairobi-gnu/c/szM2BpWwJ5M).
    Finally, wrt the LUG, I started a conversation on adding proper
    licensing [here](https://groups.google.com/g/nairobi-gnu/c/P8CltxEhhBI).  I hope to make the community more lively - at least
    code-wise - in the future.


## Grad School {#grad-school}

-   Aced one of my units - Applied Machine Learning - scoring a 94% in
    my projects; and a 77% in the CAT.
-   Did some group work for: "Communication Strategies for Analytics".
    Here's the work: [2020-eu-salary-analysis](https://github.com/BonfaceKilz/2020-eu-salary-analysis).
-   I still haven't started writing my dissertation.  I need to step-up
    my game on this one.
-   I haven't paid my school fees.  I won a grant that's supposed to aid
    with this.  I tried e-mailing SU but I haven't got any helpful
    response.  I'll schedule a physical meeting to visit SU and figure
    things out.
-   I have a missing unit I never sat for last year that's due next
    week.  I have the option of taking it next year, which I reckon I
    will do.  ATM, I'm swamped with too many things; and I see no point
    in sitting for an exam you haven't prepared for.
-   Yet to replace my student ID.  I requested assistance, and I'm yet
    to receive it.


## Long Form Reading {#long-form-reading}

-   Almost finished: "How to Read A Book."  Before finishing it - 2 chapters remaining - a dear one borrowed it.
-   Made good progress with:
    -   A Philosophy of Software Design.
    -   The Art of Non-Violent Communication.
-   Made little progress with: RDF for the Working Ontologist.


## Personal &amp; Miscellaneous {#personal-and-miscellaneous}

-   A quote from an article I read: "Burn out happens when work load
    exceeds the motivation to work."
-   Bought a new (small) shelf for the many physical books I own.
-   Queen Elizabeth II passed away peacefully.
-   His Excellency President William Ruto got sworn in as the 5TH
    president of Kenya.
-   Three things that help luck: (a) Deconstructing your craft so that you
    know what good opportunities look like; (b) Remaining vigilant so
    that you know when lucky breaks come your way; and (c) Acting
    quickly so that you are more likely to seize luck when it comes.
-   Replaced my National ID, and my access pass to the Nairobi Garage.
-   Both my siblings birthdays - 4 days apart - happened.
-   At some point, I crashed.
-   Not out of self-pity, but: I realize I still care a lot about my
    ex-partner.  I understand that given the strong emotions they [IMHO]
    felt against me because of being absent when they needed me most to
    be present in the way they _wanted_ [not in the way I wanted], I'll
    support them to the best of my ability, even if it means staying out
    of their life to allow them the space to feel/deal with things.
    Nevertheless, at one point in the future, when I work the courage, I
    may shoot an e-mail their way.
-   This statement influences my current understanding of what freedom
    entails: _"When we are in contact with our feelings and needs, we
    humans no longer make good slaves and underlings."_
