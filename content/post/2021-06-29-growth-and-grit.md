Writer Alice Walker on the discomfort of growth:

"Some periods of our growth are so confusing that we donâ€™t even
recognize that growth is happening. We may feel hostile or angry
or weepy and hysterical, or we may feel depressed. It would never
occur to us, unless we stumbled on a book or a person who
explained to us, that we were in fact in the process of change,
of actually becoming larger than we were before.

Whenever we grow, we tend to feel it, as a young seed must feel
the weight and inertia of the earth as it seeks to break out of
its shell on its way to becoming a plant. Often the feeling is
anything but pleasant.

But what is most unpleasant is the not knowing what is happening.
Those long periods when something inside ourselves seems to be
waiting, holding its breath, unsure about what the next step
should be... for it is in those periods that we realize that we
are being prepared for the next phase of our life and that, in
all probability, a new level of the personality is about to be
revealed."
