Writing consistently is difficult.  Writer's block is a situation
where you want (or have) to write but simply can't.  One way to
overcome writer's block is by asking the right questions.  To be able
to "ask the right questions", it is useful to first understand how
we can classify the different types of writing:

-   How - Actionable
-   What - Analytical
-   Possibilities (yes, you can) - Aspirational
-   Why - Anthropological

The above classification will form the basis of some ideas in which
you can act upon.  I list them below (from this [tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1577657196179066883)):

-   Share the story of how you got interested in your favorite topic.
-   Share your personal story - where you used to be, where you are now, and how you got here.
