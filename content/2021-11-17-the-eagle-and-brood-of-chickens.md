This was lurking around some where in my org file, and I thought it
wise to post it here.

A parable from priest and therapist Anthony de
Mello on the stories we tell ourselves:

<p class="verse">
A man found an eagle's egg and put it in a nest<br />
of a barnyard hen.  The eaglet hatched with the<br />
brood of chickens and grew up with them.<br />
<br />
All his life the eagle did what the barnyard<br />
chicks did, thinking he was a barnyard chicken.<br />
He scratched the earth for worms and insects.  He<br />
clucked and cackled.  And he would thrash his<br />
wings and fly a few feet into the air.<br />
<br />
Years passed and the eagle grew very old.  One day<br />
he saw a magnificent bird above him in the<br />
cloudless sky. It glided in graceful majesty<br />
among the powerful wind currents, with scarcely a<br />
beat of its strong golden wings.<br />
<br />
The old eagle looked up in awe.  "Who's that?" he<br />
asked.<br />
<br />
"That's the eagle, the king of the birds," said<br />
his neighbor.  "He belongs to the sky.  We belong<br />
to the earth-- we're chickens."<br />
<br />
So the eagle lived and died a chicken, for that's<br />
what he thought he was.”<br />
