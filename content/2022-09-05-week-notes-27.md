This entry - an exception - is less of a week entry, and more of a
monthly entry as I get back my grove to writing my weekly reviews.
Many things stressful things have happened, but nevertheless, we keep
going.


## Free and Open Source (FOSS) Work {#free-and-open-source--foss--work}

-   Lesson learnt: Never as a rule of thumb use "car", "cdr", "caar" and
    friends when writing scheme code - they can be a readability
    nightmare.  Instead, prefer to use the match syntax.
-   Had to have a conversation with my [boss](https://thebird.nl/) on how to be consistent with
    work.  We settled on regular daily mail patches that [Arun](https://systemreboot.net/) can review
    to give feedback.  I love this format.  I haven't been able to be
    doing that daily, but I do that regularly.
-   I've started getting into the grove of writing design docs for work
    I think will take more than a week; and also doing short 30-min
    sprints for my broken-up tasks.
-   One of the dev servers is out because of a hardware fault.  Nothing
    much I can do on that front, but regardless, I'm sure it'll be
    handled in good time.
-   Submitted and merged these PRs: [#721](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/pull/721), [#725](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/pull/725), [#728](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/pull/728) and [#729](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/pull/729). [#728](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/pull/728) is based on this [doc](https://issues.genenetwork.org/topics/better-logging).


## Grad School {#grad-school}

-   Did some long-ish 4 assignments and one projects.
-   Finished some 4 hour long CAT.
-   Fixed my R install by removing the guix-installed one, and using the
    one provided by Arch Linux.  I also did the same with `autoconf`.
-   I won the DSA grant and that's big news
-   Met my assigned SU supervisor.  We agreed that I'll begin work on my
    introduction and problem objectives on my dissertation.  I haven't
    done much work on this, but I plan to pick this up as soon as I can.
-   I have a group project due.  I'll be working on that in my spare
    time as I prepare for finals.


## Long Form Reading {#long-form-reading}

-   Made some little in progress in SICP.
-   Made good progress in "How to Read a Book."
-   New book I want to start on once I clear my queue: George Polya's
    "How to Solve It."


## Personal &amp; Miscellaneous {#personal-and-miscellaneous}

-   Fixed some long-standing issues I had with missing icons on my
    system.  The fix was simple: `guix install adwaita-icon-theme`
-   Embraced quiy [some niche ontology] for folders in my systems -
    helps with fuzzy searching: "lq": policies; "rqr": tasks; "rq":
    research; "oq": language/system-tool; and "jq": configuration.  This
    is in addition to using "," for my user-scripts.
-   I noticed that the Nairobi Garage's - Spring Valley - was blocking
    my ntp packets.  In the process of figuring this out, I also noticed
    that they blocked many useful ports (including port 22).  The staff
    was very helpful - they wound up providing an alternative WiFi
    access point for member's use.
-   Elections happened; and were disputed in the supreme court.  The end
    result is that Hon. William Ruto is now the 5th president of Kenya.
-   I broke up with my [ex] partner.  This has been such a painful
    experience for me and I'm still dealing with [in a positive way].  I
    was concerned about how it would affect my other aspects of life.
    So far, I've been dealing with it in a decent way.  Important
    questions I've been pondering - with help - are: _What did falling in
    love do for me?_ _What have I learnt from this relationship?_ _What
    would I do differently?_
-   Lost my wallet.  Only important things that I lost were access pass
    (already replaced), my student ID and my national ID.  I'll be
    replacing the latter and former some time this month.
