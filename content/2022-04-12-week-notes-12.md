## Free And Open Source(FOSS) Work {#free-and-open-source--foss--work}

-   Fixed an issue wrt inserting case attributes
    that have the same name: [#90](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork3/pull/90) and [#695](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/pull/695). Read more
    about this issue [here](https://issues.genenetwork.org/issues/fix-case-attribute-work.html).
-   I made some improvements on gn2's uploader
    interface: [#696](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/pull/696) and [#36d2cbc](https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/commit/36d2cbc96bd5219e044ce1728f750ceefd0fa5f6). Read more
    about this [here](https://issues.genenetwork.org/issues/metadata-edits-improvements.html).
-   Some [minor] work on [tissue](https://git.systemreboot.net/tissue). I haven't made any
    progress with this.
-   I opened a new issue regarding SQL generating a
    "too many connections" error in our CI. Read
    more [here](https://issues.genenetwork.org/issues/sql-too-many-connections.html).
-   New [suggestion](https://issues.genenetwork.org/issues/cool-issues-we-should-emulate.html) on improving some of
    Genenetwork's UI.
-   I had a look at Qiuiy. I think it's mentioned in
    [this](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/minimalsyntaxes/) talk.


## Grad School {#grad-school}

-   Handed in some assignment on "Linear Models"-- a
    unit I'm enrolled in. This assignment emphasized
    using Regularized models on some provided
    dataset in R.
-   Started an advanced Bio-Informatics course to
    supplement my Genenetwork work. This has had the
    negative side-effect of taking my attention off
    work. Juggling [SU] school work, FOSS work and
    this course is demanding on my day. Good thing
    is that this is only temporary. I will have
    finished this course by the end of this week.
-   I did my first Continuous Assessment Test (CAT)
    last week for the "Linear Models" unit. It was
    an open-book assessment and IMO it went well.
-   There's a take-away CAT whose submission is due
    next week Monday.
-   In one of my classes, some one shared how they
    used "Concept Synthesis" method to do their
    literature review. I'll adapt this to Org mode
    and hopefully blog about it.
-   Interesting thing I learned about the grading
    process at SU: for poorly performed units, the
    results get standardized to get a bell-shaped
    curve. I think this used to happen in UoN.


## Books {#books}

-   Started reading Mario Puzo's "The
    Godfather". Finished Book I, II and III. This is
    a classic read.
-   Slow progress with: "The Sense of Style" by
    Steven Pinker.
-   Started reading: "The Bed of Procrustes" by
    Nassim Nicholas Taleb.
-   Got physical copies of: "Team of Rivals" by
    Kearns Goodwin and "Tiny Habits" by BJ Fogg.


## Personal &amp; Miscellaneous {#personal-and-miscellaneous}

-   [Week Highlight] I watched the movie: "Morbius"
    with dear ones \m/\m/
-   My partner asked me a question along the lines:
    "What does loving yourself look like?" This
    probably deserves a post of its own.
-   I want to incorporate study(not limited to
    MSc. work only) into my daily routine.
-   Open question: How do you deal with information
    overload? How do you deal with anxiety and
    over-whelm?
-   There's a [boiler-room](https://boilerroom.tv/session/buruklyn-boyz-more-boiler-room-x-ballantines-true-music-studios-nairobi#access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6Ik1VWTROa0UwTURCQlEwUTBNamhDUlVOR04wTkdNRFl6UkRsQlJUSTJSRE16UkVaQlJqWTROZyJ9.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.ZhDWn9r6UTcC2TaHu6gqjZUGl31LRAVR-8Q_JMDjwglhNDS8euOHRG5ElxAsdQb7gtHBM6T3iLRRixEJ6K0wvD3vuzI5dIMFd452j_1fc1GcdohH6SWFCEJ4zX5T0Ke-KfG4ajGy3rguf7EBudoMCpXsU5wXx2JB97Y_TMTJsJxkfvRePFU9Tibx3sL5cs6Ub4312Aohn5-8GjRk5gy9ecmUeAoKwn3j2uCDL2OvkIq8to3FEtkKekiVm1wbBwfCiHHQ2i1iAMEEX31D0MrnZ8CkPSrsCh5e-4aQA66meNkPq52QyK9rIHObBKj0gUlxHv-c79UFckmky0cMPQB5KA&state=kzqwaQk3VcPZGjKP3HzNI0YDr2Mx2q5X) event here in Nairobi this
    week. Too bad, I don't have the band-width to
    attend this event.
-   Ideas for "deep" resting: showers, talking to
    dear ones, and social events.
-   Had my first "real" swim workout at YMCA.
-   Started learning the Palmer method of writing.
