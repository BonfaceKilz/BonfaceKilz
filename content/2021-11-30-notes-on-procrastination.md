This are my notes from the app "Intellect":

-   Procrastination is a coping mechanism to avoid discomfort
-   This mechanism sometimes then becomes a habit.

The first step to overcoming your procrastination is to be aware of
what your discomfort is.  You should use the [feelings wheel](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57b5ef68c534a5cc06edc769/t/5ea76681f6730e409abf228b/1588030494465/Feelings+Wheel.pdf) to assist
with this.

To overcome procrastination:

-   Complete the smallest step in a task (e.g., if it's school work, log in
    to the e-Learning Portal).
-   Spent just 5 -- 10 minutes on the task and use that momentum.
-   Visualise your success when you complete the task.
