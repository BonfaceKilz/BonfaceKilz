Podcasts have become a great part of my personal life. I love podcasts because you get to while your time away in such a decent productive fashion in places such as traffic jams, or when doing some dull repetitive chores. Don't jump to the conclusion that I only listen to podcasts when I have nothing better to do; That's far from the truth. I listen to podcasts because the shows expose a different way of thinking in addition to sharing some really great insight into some stuff. You also get to 'interact' with some really great people who are doing it big in their respective fields. I thought it'd be cool to write a list of all the podcasts I am currently listening to. This list is no specific order.

Here are all the podcasts I listen to:

1. [Stuff You Should Know](http://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts&sa=U&ved=0ahUKEwivmO7A8MfUAhVIVxoKHZkyC1UQFggTMAA&sig2=yn648UCiPguV4l4qTp-6fg&usg=AFQjCNEr4n-iEv-2MV2HyYzde6NTkRF5ywhttp://www.google.com/url?q=http://shows.howstuffworks.com/&sa=U&ved=0ahUKEwivmO7A8MfUAhVIVxoKHZkyC1UQFggjMAI&sig2=nNQK-S62fET-lRg1J9lgLA&usg=AFQjCNF96qxcv0o9JfWDQMiA9RSFGL8SVQhttp://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.howstuffworks.com/&sa=U&ved=0ahUKEwjZsoqd8MfUAhVFnBoKHU6TDmEQFggUMAA&sig2=NsVBVTHsBmsh-JikyikGuA&usg=AFQjCNEQXnPjYyzrN3qEpcMUoY9TbMM9HwURL ): This show explores how stuff works. Stuff being anything the hosts can think to talk about. I find both hosts: Charles (Chuck) Bryant and Josh Clark interesting people in how they present this show. They sometimes talk about weird things like: Do you stay conscious after being [decapitated](http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/do-you-stay-conscious-after-being-decapitated.htmURL )
2. [Packet Pushers](http://www.google.com/url?q=http://packetpushers.net/&sa=U&ved=0ahUKEwjf_aax8sfUAhWHSRoKHcNqBlIQFggUMAA&sig2=05PAGq9wYThrR1TIsBJifQ&usg=AFQjCNHhyQitSaVEthsiFTYKpVAuKzARNgURL ): A network of technology podcasts where real engineers get into the weeds about networking, data centers, and enterprise IT. For me, listening to this podcast makes me humble. It makes me realise how little I know in addition to pushing me to keep learning new stuff and leveling up.
3. [Geek Rant](http://www.google.com/url?q=http://elementopie.com/geekrant-episodes&sa=U&ved=0ahUKEwishPmO88fUAhXBSRoKHaqgB1UQFggVMAA&sig2=RQiZlarp40YYgxUTPRHKEg&usg=AFQjCNEbtk5bZySMn6-GhO4WkbV7rHcm0QURL ): A podcasts for geeks. Tech news, social, and political commentary, family-friendly humor, and of course bacon await you in this show. Occasionally, you learn new interesting stuff, like how HP(the company) had this audio driver that had keylogging capabilities, or how Microsoft's Windows 10 S kinda sucks(which is kinda obvious).
4. [99% Invisible](http://www.google.com/url?q=http://99percentinvisible.org/&sa=U&ved=0ahUKEwiExLX288fUAhWFnRoKHd2rCV8QFggWMAA&sig2=U2ZMontIuNhjyOEbdb5z9g&usg=AFQjCNEIizdZAsibbVzMAtjZan20NSzVZgURL ): A show hosted by Roman Mars, a guy that has a golden radio voice in addition to being a great narrator. This show is about all the thought that goes into the things we don't think about- the unnoticed architechture and design that shape our world.
5. [Freakonomics Radio](http://www.google.com/url?q=http://freakonomics.com/&sa=U&ved=0ahUKEwjl5Ly-9MfUAhXC2BoKHXJzD1kQFggTMAA&sig2=kyCSse_lPzRSi14n9s5_GA&usg=AFQjCNEbmajEgNQsxlgA1J3rqUXt3m-h7QURL ): Another podcast about finding the hidden side of things. This podcasts talks about the riddles of everyday life and the weird wrinkles of human nature- from cheating and crime to parenting and sports. This is really a *fun* podcast to listen to.
6.

Where sound illuminates ideas, and the boundaries blur between science, philosophy, and human experience. Radiolab is an investigation told through sounds and stories, and centered around one big idea. In the Radiolab world, information sounds like music and science and culture colliding. These guys do better reporting(by far) than the local(Kenyan) reporters- They are that good! Needless to say, they are one of my favorite podcasts to listen to.
7. [The Engineering Commons](http://www.google.com/url?q=http://theengineeringcommons.com/&sa=U&ved=0ahUKEwikwdPG9sfUAhWDlxoKHQKWB14QFggUMAA&sig2=ieyx6VX66zs66_QadlRwJA&usg=AFQjCNH9uuLBC9YN9nz4PaiL_8wGYaOinAURL ): This is a podcast about Engineers and Engineering as a profession.

Each show has a theme, explored in several "acts". Occasionally, an entire show will consist of a single act. I like this show because it's "deep" and "soulful". It makes you mindful about life(and death). Definitely interesting.
15.

Every episode re-examines something from the past- an event, a person, an idea, even a song- and asks whether we got it right the first time.
