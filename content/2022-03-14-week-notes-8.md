## Personal & Miscellaneous {#personal-and-miscellaneous}

-   I went on my first Safari ever at [Silole sanctuary](https://silolesanctuary.com/). This was a great
    experience. I'll try to blog about it later this week. Some big
    thing I got out of this is that I now have a deeper appreciation for
    nature and our environment; also I now appreciate quiet spaces.
-   My Bullet Journal filled up, so I moved to a new one. I'm currently
    using an Eregatti leather notebook, and thus far I love the
    experience. The quality of paper is better than my previous moleskin
    journals. I also prepared some other moleskin journal for taking
    notes-- this will be my reading journal.
-   My health situation got worse: puffy eyes, puffy (painful) lips and
    rashes in random places in my body. I went to the hospital and was
    give anti-histamines.
-   In the aforementioned visit to the hospital, I insisted on a
    diabetic test. Good news: I'm no longer pre-diabetic; my blood sugar
    levels are level. A life-style change definitely contributed to
    this.
-   Bought the Book: "Godfather" by Mario Puzo.
-   Hanged out at Pallet Caffe in Gigiri to celebrate a dear one's
    birthday. Huge question that came up: "How would you want people to
    celebrate you?"
