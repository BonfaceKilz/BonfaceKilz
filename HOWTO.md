## Introduction

This repository contains all the code for my [blog](https://blog.bonfacemunyoki.com "my blog").

The website is powered by [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/ "Zola")-- a static site generator written in Rust -- and uses a theme called [Radion](https://github.com/micahkepe/radion.git "theme used").

## How to build

Make sure you have Zola [installed](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/ "how to install zola").

To preview all the content, including the draft articles:

```
zola serve
```

To generate the website:

```
zola build
```
